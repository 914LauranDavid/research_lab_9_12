"blueapples on XOne of the most confounding responses to the belief that the 2020 Presidential Election was rigged to keep Donald Trump from being re-elected has been the Republicans' belief that voting in 2024 will somehow get him back into office. In the build up to this year's presidential election,there have been ample signs that the integrity of America's elections is still compromised.The cognitive dissonance of the right wing of the US electorate has led them to overlook clear indications that 2024 could be nothing more than a replay of 2020.",right,2020
"There has beenno greater sign of the continued attempts to corrupt the electoral process than with what happened during an ABC broadcast of a Formula 1 race on Sunday. During the Mexico Grand Prix,viewers watching on the Pennsylvania local ABC affiliate WNEP-TV saw the station reporting the results of the presidential election in the state, with Kamala Harris winning by 5% over Donald Trump.The margin of victory for Harris of nearly 300,000 votes eclipses the amount Biden ""won"" the state by in 2020 by nearly 4 times as much. The ABC affiliate responded to claims that their broadcast signified a predetermined outcome by stating that the graphic had been randomly generated as part of a test of the systems in place for their forthcoming coverage on election night.",right,2020
"Currently, 1,550,128 votes have been cast either by mail or early in-person voting. In total, 2,186,450 mail-in ballots were requested in the state for this year's election.In 2020, mail-in ballots from the Democratic stronghold of Philadelphia alone took nearly 4 days to count.The lack of initiative taken to change the state's election laws means that the outcome of the race in Pennsylvania may not be known until days after election night yet again.Despite the response by WNEP-TV to assuage the public of concerns that the ""mistake"" was not indicative of anything more than a technical error,the gaffe by the station raises more questions about if votes in swing states will be manipulated in favor of the Democratic establishment.If Trump does go on to lose the 2024 election, this moment is sure to rear its ugly head as evidence in support of claims that the election was rigged against him yet again.",right,2020
"But of course not in the way the Left claims. In the guest post below, our friend Kevin Dolan gives us a grim but necessary warning about what will happen if Trump loses the election. Before we get to that, a brief follow up on our previous post (""Weaponizing The Department Of Justice"").",right,2020
"It depended on thousands of people sharing an unspoken confidence that “everyone was doing it”, and that they would get away with it. And sure enough, every institution of political and metapolitical power rallied around “respecting the outcome”, including Trump’s own party and Cabinet. This time,the picture is much more complicated— and Trump is promising to aggressively prosecute “Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials” who committed electoral fraud if he wins.",right,2020

"Both Trump’s personal associates, and the segment of the population that he represents, were already up against existential risks. Threatening them does not really introduce any new disincentives —the penalty for being late is the same as the penalty for rebellion, and we are already late.",right,2020
"Are they sure that everyone else is sure? If Trump loses the election, it will mean the total & permanent closure of the American political system. Kamala Harris was practically grown in a lab to demonstrate the limits of manufacturing consent — the ultimate act of political creationex nihilo.",right,2020
"The only issue that has generated any enthusiasm for Kamala Harris is abortion: an issue that Donald Trump can’t even pretend to care about, and never made any gestures toward, even in the primaries.",right,2020
"You might believe it’s still possible for them to steal it, but you’d be hard pressed to argue that it will be easier. I think they threw everything they had at Trump in 2020. Many ground-level Democrat election workers are likely thinking the same thing, and they need to be fully convinced.",right,2020
"At the end of Obama’s second term, the gold price had fallen by roughly 20%. Trump entered the Oval Office and golddroppedby more than 5% on his inauguration day. However, by the end of his four-year term it had made an all-time high of $2,067/oz (August 2020) before settling around $1,900/oz on election day 2020.",right,2020
"Joe Biden became president next, and the gold price declined by just under 1% as the results came in and fell an additional 1.3% when he was inaugurated a few months later.",right,2020
"As we write this, it is registering a gain of around 43% during the Biden administration. Having said that, what if gold responds more to policy than the specific president?",right,2020
"Emboldened by that ascendancy, supporters of Donald Trump approach the forthcoming presidential election as if they are impervious to defeat.",right,2020
"It needn't take much effort to examine the parallels between 2020 and 2024. Much like outgoing president Joe Biden, Kamala Harris is the preferred candidate of the existing political establishment.As Seymour Hersh's recent reporting on the Obama-led soft coup shows, she too has been installed as the democratic nominee for president in direct contradiction to achieving the distinction through the electoral process she and her party have exalted as sacrosanct to distinguish them as morally superior to their opposition.The chronology of Harris' selection hearkens back to the process that saw her latch onto Biden to become Vice President to begin with. Although the same chain of events that culminated in the 2020 election being manipulated to deny Donald Trump his re-election emerging yet again, his supporters have become utterly oblivious and completely dismissive of the premise that the same outcome could be achieved in 2024, despite the same framework clearly being in place.",right,2020

The facade of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 created an entirely unprecedented election process which catered to the scale of electoral fraud needed to have Biden installed as president.

"However, those historical parallels aren't confined to 1968 alone.The crossroads that democrats find themselves at now echoes the position the republican party found itself in during the wake of the Obama administration in which it finds itself needing to cultivate a new identity to shed itself of the stigma its previous leadership had mired it in.While the bombastic leadership of Donald Trump ushered in that sea change in 2016 by reshaping the neoconservative political platform republicans were rooted in into the direction of a populist one, the radical platform the democratic party has embedded itself in up to 2024 makes its chances of re-branding itself into something more palatable for the American electorate even more unlikely than even the unforeseen outcome of the 2016 presidential election.",right,2020

"When the Democratic Party last faced an existential crisis of this magnitude following resounding defeats in three successive presidential elections,it was ironically Joe Biden who played a role in reshaping its identity to better contend against its republican opposition.Then-Senators Al Gore and Joe Biden ran under the New Democrat platform in the 1988 Presidential Election as they hoped to build a faction that would usher in the new leadership the party so desperately needed at the time. While their candidacies were to no avail, they set the tone for the party moving forward as it would ultimately triumph in 1992 built upon the centrist foundation it had cultivated in the years prior.",right,2020
"For the Democratic Party to shed itself of the failures of the Biden administration,it would require a stark deviation away from the radical platform it has built itself upon since 2020.In doing so, the democrats could effectively run themselves as the uniparty by fostering a political climate more conducive to moderate voters much like how Bill Clinton successfully did in forming the New Democrat ideology that won him consecutive elections in 1992 and 1996 at a time the Democratic Party was in shambles every bit as much as it is today.",right,2020
"Not only does that defined course of action exist but a perfect candidate to be the figurehead of that new identity had as well: West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin. Sources close to Sen Joe Manchin, independent of WV, say he's considering re-registering as a Democrat and throwing his hat into the ring However, the radical direction the Biden Administration has taken its party in places anyone who skewed more centrist like Manchin into political exile. That alienation was culminated by Manchin's decision to register as an Independent in 2024, leaving the party altogether.The hostile dynamic fomented by the Democratic Party that saw Manchin leave its ranks is a microcosm of how it has dug its own grave heading into the 2024 Presidential Electionas it now finds itself rudderless and without any alternative other than to steer itself on the same course that has led the party to its impending doom.The toxic culture created by democrats remains every bit as pervasive today despite the obvious detriment it has become to their political viability.Rumors arising the Manchin is contemplating re-registering as a democrat to contend for the party's nomination have been immediately and vociferously rejected by democrat voters whose unyielding radicism represents the norm within the party.Even if Manchin could serve as a legitimate candidate who could challenge Trump, democratic voters have been so deluded under Biden's leadership that they still do not demonstrate an iota of self awareness when it comes to how their radical platform has been firmly rejected for being incongruent with the course that lies ahead if America is to reshape its trajectory in the hopes of having any future whatsoever.",right,2020

The toll that has taken appears to finally have come due as the Democratic Party's apparent decision to double-down on the radical political platform that has been the cornerstone of a presidential administration with some of the lowest approval ratings in history by investing itself in Kamala Harris as the future of the party. That decision has snuffed out any rekindled optimism of their chances to name a candidate like Manchin who could serve as a competent adversary to Donald Trump in the wake of Joe Biden dropping out of the 2024 race.

"We will respond following receipt of this advice and further evaluation of the letters.”While the statement demonstrates the uncertainty behind the legal authority of the governor to investigate and oversee the hearings of the State Electon Board, what is certain is that Kemp is weighing that legality against the mounting political pressure aimed at him. Governor Kemp formally requesting an advisory opinion on what authority he has to remove the members embroiled by the ethics complaint from the State Election Board comes at a time wherePresident Donald Trump has thrust whose members into the limelight by defending their commitment to upholding the integrity of elections.Trump went on to take aim at Kemp for not supporting the board during an August 3rd rally held in Atlanta. During the rally, Trump ad-libbed that Kemp was a ""very average governor"" in addition to calling his character into question by being disloyal.",right,2020

"For example, Trump’s border-wall order was challenged in court for overstepping spending authority, and Biden later rescinded it. Without a court ruling,only a president can reverse an executive order, though Congress can pass legislation to override it.",right,2020

"Trump, the GOP frontrunner in the 2024 presidential election,took to Truth Social, his social media platform, on Thursdayto conduct his own real-time commentary during Biden's State of the Union address, criticizing the president as they prepare to likely face off against each other in November in a 2020 election rematch… ""The pandemic no longer controls our lives,"" Biden said. ""The vaccines that saved us from COVID are now being used to help beat cancer, turning setback into comeback.",right,2020
"That's what America does."" Trump labeled Biden's entire speech as ""the Angriest, Least Compassionate, and Worst State of the Union Speech ever made,"" calling it ""an Embarrassment to our Country!"" He also took umbrage with Biden taking credit for ending the pandemic, while using the president's exact words. ""'The Pandemic no longer controls our lives.",right,2020

"Yes. But Trump is not anyone’s savior; I’m not in the business of blindly propping up politicians in the hopes that they’ll serve as the second coming of Jesus. If that’s what you’re into, that’s why God invented Sean Hannity and Laura Loomer.",right,2020
Here’s a modest proposal: I’ll relentlessly shill for Trump with no qualifications once he ceases bragging about his complicity in the greatest crime in human history. Or is that too high of a bar for the former president to clear?,right,2020
"We all know of our utter worthlessness to the well-heeled, especially the ruling elites. Now, as President Joe Biden mulls (or drools with a blank stare) over green-lighting a clown dictator’s use of American and British long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia, the multitudes are shocked! For many of us, however, the atomic clock will soon be at 1 second to midnight.",right,2020

"It warns those at risk of future heart failure due to 'persistent infection of SARS-CoV-2 (Covis-19) is expected to exponentially increase'.” The Brandon entity’s abysmal poll numbers as an incumbent president are so deep underwater that it’s literally statistically impossible, based on years of polling precedent, for him to win in 2024 barring widespread vote-rigging that would make 2020 look like itreallywas the most “secure election in history.” It’s no wonder, then, that his media tools are grasping at straws for something,anythingto sell the public on his presidency. Democrat strategist Simon Rosenberg, in that pursuit, is drawing yet again from the COVID well Groundhog Day-style: “The central promise of Biden in 2020 was that he was going to get us through COVID and get us to the other side successfully. That’s really what the election was litigated on when you look back at polling and look at the election in 2020.",right,2020
And I think on that central promise Joe Biden has been successful. He did what he said he was gonna do.,right,2020
"Everyone knows the election was a decisive victory for Donald Trump, so there is no need to rehash the ins and outs of the numbers. Trump very clearly has a mandate, and with Republicans picking up Senate seats they were widely expected to secure back in 2022 but didn’t, American citizens have now made one of the boldest statements in the country’s history.",right,2020

"This wasn’t a case of some slight liberal bias over the last few months; instead it wasfull-scale outright lying, deceptive editing of Harris’ interview responses, blatant,one-sided fact-checking that often ignored the facts, and a nonstop 24-hour cycle painting Donald Trump as the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler.",right,2020
