"(Cheers, applause.) Whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone — (cheers, applause) — whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made a difference. (Cheers, applause.) I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard-fought campaign. (Cheers, applause.) We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future.",left,2012
"And that is a legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. (Cheers, applause.) In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward. (Cheers, applause.) I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years, America's happy warrior, the best vice president anybody could ever hope for, Joe Biden.",left,2012
"President! PRESIDENT OBAMA:I'm not talking about blind optimism, the kind of hope that just ignores the enormity of the tasks ahead or the road blocks that stand in our path. I'm not talking about the wishful idealism that allows us to just sit on the sidelines or shirk from a fight.",left,2012
"East Coast. Pew president Andrew Kohut tells NPR's Guy Raz that the shift back toward Obama was partially because of his handling of the aftermath of the storm. ""Two-thirds of the likely voters we questioned said they approved of the way he handled it,"" Kohut says.",left,2012
"The poll adds, however, that voter turnout remains one of the GOP nominee's strengths. Romney's supporters are more engaged in the election and more committed to voting than are Obama's supporters, the poll found. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",left,2012
"By Mark Memmott Some of the faces of those who supported the president, at his victory rally Tuesday in Chicago.Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Imageshide caption Some of the faces of those who supported the president, at his victory rally Tuesday in Chicago. NPR.org'sScott Neuman wrote earlierabout how ""a mixture of demographics, superior organization and a few tactical missteps from Republicans"" helped President Obama win the battleground states. From this morning's post-election analyses of the presidential campaign, here are three more looks at why Obama was re-elected Tuesday: --The New York Times: ""In Chicago, the [Obama] campaign recruited a team of behavioral scientists to build an extraordinarily sophisticated database packed with names of millions of undecided voters and potential supporters.",left,2012
"In the months leading up to the election, Obama announced his support for same-sex marriage, unilaterally granted a form of limited legalization to young illegal immigrants and put abortion rights and contraception at the heart of a brutally effective anti-Romney attack ad campaign.""The result turned out to be an unbeatable combination: virtually universal support from black voters, who turned out as strongly as in 2008, plus decisive backing from members of the younger and fast-growing Latino and Asian American communities, who chose Obama over Romney by ratios of roughly 3 to 1. All of those groups contributed to Obama's majority among women. (Gay voters, a far smaller group, went for Obama by a 54-point margin.)"" --The Wall Street Journal: ""Mitt Romney is one of the wealthiest men ever to run for president.",left,2012
"But even those losses were not enough to knock him from the presidency, and part of that, according to Kohut, had to do with likability. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney delivers his concession speech in Boston.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide caption Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney delivers his concession speech in Boston. ""Fifty-three percent of people said they approved of how Obama handled his job,"" Kohut says.",left,2012
"""Fifty-three percent of people said they approved of how Obama handled his job,"" Kohut says. ""And a president with that kind of approval rating doesn't lose his job."" Romney never recovered from two negative perceptions: that as head of Bain Capital, he cared more about profits than jobs; and his ""47 percent"" comment, when he suggested that nearly half of Americans see themselves as ""victims"" and expect the government to support them. It is not yet clear that the president will win the popular vote.",left,2012
"""The most surprising thing was that the move toward the president was as distinctive as it was in the final days of the campaign,"" NPR Political Editor Ron Elving said. In recent days, polls showed Obama gaining momentum in battleground states. And if trends hold, it is possible that the president will win all eight of them.",left,2012

"The Democrats' overwhelming defeat in the midterm elections leaves President Obama with difficult choices ahead. Patrick Caddell has some advice: He should declare himself a one-term president, and spend the remainder of his time in the White House focusing on national problems, not campaigning.

""There was a time in the summer,"" he says, ""when the Obama campaign got the upper hand on the ad wars, but for the most part it was about other things."" Things like grass-roots infrastructure. ""The Obama campaign had many more field offices than [Mitt] Romney, and they had many more people on the ground, knocking on doors,"" he says.",left,2012
"Here's a quick look at the decisive factors in some battleground states: Florida, Nevada And Colorado The Latino vote made a difference in all three states. Many pollsters showed Florida leaning toward Romney immediately ahead of the voting. But the state, while technically not decided, is where Republican weakness among Latinos was most telling, Geer notes.",left,2012
"Overwhelming support among blacks was key. In fact, Obama's support amongwhitesin Ohio dropped enough from 2008 that Romney potentially could have taken the state had it not been for the higher African-American turnout. Virginia Here's another state where demographics played a key role, Edwards says.",left,2012
"Senate race] underscores that."" U.S. Newsbreaks it down this way: ""[Obama] posted big margins in the more liberal counties of Northern Virginia, or NOVA. But to eke out his victory, he also made inroads in the crucial swing area of Prince William County, once considered the dividing line between NOVA and the more conservative ROVA, or 'Rest of Virginia.' And exit polls showed he performed better in the eastern half of the state than Democrat John Kerry in 2004."" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",left,2012
"Bush's campaigns of the 2000s get credit for early mining of consumer data. Obama's campaign, however, is credited with taking the data analysis to the next level, refining the process campaigns have used to score potential voters on their likelihood to turn out for a particular candidate on Election Day in much the same way credit issuers score consumers on their likeliness to repay debts. This meant mining consumer data and other information from millions of would-be voters to find patterns that indicated political leanings and how persuadable they might be.",left,2012
"And there were thereported 66,000 daily computer simulationsthe campaign ran to model Election Day variables to help it decide where to expend more time and money. ""We had to win this on the micro stuff,"" Obama campaign manager Jim Messina said at a post-election conference of political consultants,according to Buzzfeed.

It just seemed to have less success.",left,2012
"While it's impossible to quantify how much data-driven and social-science approach accounts for the president's success, Obama's strong showing surprised many political observers, and certainly many in Romney's presidential campaign. They had assumed Obama couldn't match, let alone exceed, his strong 2008 showing with key parts of his coalition, especially African-Americans and young voters. But he did.",left,2012
"""The Democrats start with a larger number of electoral votes in the bank,"" says Daron Shaw, author ofThe Race to 270,a book about electoral strategy. That's because while the election is still very much in the air, Obama can count on a larger store of electoral votes that are all but guaranteed to him than Romney can. Other than Texas, states where Republicans are certain winners, such as Oklahoma, Idaho, Alabama and Alaska, simply don't offer all that many electoral votes.",left,2012
"That's why there's been talk all year that Romney has only a ""narrow path"" to electoral victory, heavily contingent on his carrying Florida and Ohio. ""Really, what it comes down to, the Republicans have to win the battleground states to win the Electoral College,"" says Lara Brown, a political scientist at Villanova University in Pennsylvania.",left,2012
"GOP consultant Whit Ayres says the ""critical swing area"" is the Midwest. ""Whoever controls that region tends to control the nation right now,"" he says, ""because that region is still competitive for both parties, other than Illinois."" That may be bad news for Romney. States such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have not supported a GOP presidential nominee since 1988.",left,2012
"By contrast, Obama and Bill Clinton each won at least 365 electoral votes with their winning campaigns. In each of the five presidential contests dating back to 1992, Democrats have won at least 252 electoral votes.",left,2012
"Four years ago, the nation's largest state gave Obama 61 percent of its popular vote in 2008 — and its 55 electoral votes. ""Throw in New York and Illinois, where Republicans did well for a very long time, and you have three huge states that have become solidly Democratic,"" Ayres says.",left,2012
"All of this means that Obama still has the potential to take more than 300 electoral votes. A Romney victory is likely to be narrower, in terms of electoral votes. But another real possibility is that Romney begins the process of reshaping the map, winning states that haven't gone Republican for a number of years.",left,2012

"""A lot of the time, newly elected and re-elected presidents get more than you think they could,"" Bernstein says. But on those issues — as well as many others — Obama cannot count on help from Republicans in Congress. The president's desires will clearly do much to shape the national agenda over the coming years, but his narrow win suggests that there is a lack of consensus for his policies.",left,2012
"""There really are some basic splits between the two parties that each represent half the country."" Obama, in fact, appears, like his predecessor, to have been more of a divider than a uniter. He certainly has not ushered in a post-partisan era of good feelings, as some of his supporters thought possible four years ago.",left,2012
"A big majority of white voters supported his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, while Obama won even bigger margins among Hispanic andAfrican-American voters.

By Mark Stencel Were last night's convention references to Barack Obama's mother and her struggles with an insurance company before her death a powerful argument for health care reform?,left,2012
The story came up twice — in Vice President Joe Biden's speech and in a seven-minute video preceding President Obama's address.,left,2012

WHAT WE KNOW The issue for Dunham wasn't actually her health coverage; she had that.",left,2012
"It was a rejected claim on her disability insurance. A 2011 biography of Obama's mother byNew York Timesjournalist Janny Scott found that Dunham's health insurance plan ""covered most of the costs of her medical treatment"" for uterine and ovarian cancer. InA Singular Woman: The Untold Story of Barack Obama's Mother, Scott wrote that Dunham pursued a disability claim for help covering ""several hundred dollars a month"" in deductibles and other uncovered medical expenses.",left,2012
"In their convention remarks, the Obamas and Biden were careful to avoid saying Dunham's insurance company denied her coverage or treatment.

AsPolitiFact noted, Obama often used similar language to describe his mother's situation during the long debate leading up to passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. PolitiFact singled out this August 2009 statement during a town hall meeting in Portsmouth, N.H., as an example: ""I will never forget my own mother, as she fought cancer in her final months, having to worry about whether her insurance would refuse to pay for her treatment.",left,2012

White House spokesman Nicholas Papas was unapologetic, standing by the past statements without challenging Scott's reporting: ""We have not reviewed the letters or other material on which the author bases her account,"" Papas told theTimes.

Here's a quick review of five takeaways from the first debate in Denver: Obama Looked Tired And Sounded Defensive Obama's advisers noted before the debate that the president was having a hard time finding much unbroken debate practice time, and much of what he did have was devoted to boiling down his positions to fit the time limits.

""I had the great experience — it didn't seem like it at the time — of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat,"" Romney said, ""and that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done.""

"Trump signed an executive order to dissolve the Commission, and he has asked the Department of Homeland Security to review its initial findings and determine next courses of action."" Trump created the commission in May 2017 after he continued to insist that as many as 5 million votes were cast illegally in the November 2016 presidential election where he bested Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. But there has been no evidence to back up that claim, and the president's assertions have been dismissed by election officials and experts.",left,2016
"But there has been no evidence to back up that claim, and the president's assertions have been dismissed by election officials and experts. Trump won the Electoral College, giving him the White House, but he lost the popular vote to Clinton byalmost 3 million votes. Multiple lawsuits were filed against the group, which some Republicans on the panel last fall complained ultimately hobbled its work.",left,2016
"Much of the country woke up the day after in disbelief at the news of his election, even as financial markets were reeling from a night ofselloffs around the world. Yet Trump racked up a clear majority in the Electoral College. And he did it by winning the Anglo white vote (58 percent of it, according to the exit polls).",left,2016
"Trump won the last three by about 1 percentage point each — and with those slim margins, he claimed the presidency. Trump narrowly lost those voters who have a college degree. But he managed to win among white college graduates by 4 percentage points, avoiding a loss with this group that would have been the first for a Republican nominee since data of this kind have been collected.",left,2016
"He did it making friendly noises toward Russian President Vladimir Putin. But those who do like Trump, or who dislike all his rivals more, were enough to make him a winner. It started in the primaries.",left,2016
"Trump said outrageous things, insulting former prisoner of war John McCain and Fox News host Megyn Kelly, among others. He refused to commit to supporting the Republican nominee unless his own candidacy was ""treated fairly."" None of this seemed to bother Trump supporters nearly as much as we, the pros, said it had to. And when a Muslim couple with ties to ISIS killed 14 people and wounded 22 more in San Bernardino on Dec.",left,2016
"Trump's candidacy took off again after he called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. Trump stitched together an unlikely coalition of voters to outpace 16 intraparty rivals. He did it with outreach to those not yet recovered from the 2008-09 recession, or from the loss of high-wage factory jobs.",left,2016
"John Kasich was boycotting the proceedings. And once he had become the nominee of the Republican Party, Trump needed only to hold his base constituency and add the reluctant votes of other Republicans and compatible independents. He didn't need all those GOP officeholders who kept their distance or the big donors who looked away or the conservative opinion-makers who denounced him.",left,2016
Clinton's lead in some polls ran out to double digits. Then came a ray of hope.,left,2016
"FBI Director James Comey announced the discovery of a new stash of emails that might be relevant to the earlier, months-long investigation of Clinton's personal email server. Suddenly, the Democratic nominee was back at the bottom of the rain barrel.",left,2016
"So on election eve, the consensus of high-quality independent polling was that Clinton was leading nationally by 4 points. Most of us pros were expecting the suspense to be about her margin of victory.",left,2016
Franklin/APhide caption Supporters of Trump celebrate election results in Phoenix on Tuesday. In the 7 p.m.,left,2016
"In the 7 p.m. hour, the news from Florida and North Carolina — and even Georgia — suggested that new voters, and especially Hispanics, were giving Clinton a chance to win these states. Had she done so in Florida, she would have reversed the story of the night.",left,2016
"Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States. That's remarkable for all sorts of reasons: He has no governmental experience, for example.",left,2016
"But right now, it's also remarkable because almost no one saw it coming. All major forecasters predicted a Hillary Clinton win, whether moderately or by a landslide. So what happened?",left,2016
"Currently, exit polling shows Trump's margin among that group to be roughly one-and-a-half times that. Meanwhile, college-educated whites appear to have preferred Trump slightly, according to current exit poll figures (which, once again, could still shift some). That would mean Trump moderately underperformed Romney, who won this group by 14 points, according to the data from Pew.",left,2016
"However, that would still essentially be a win for Trump, considering that at one point, it looked like Trump might be thefirst Republican in decadesto lose white, college-educated Americans. Clinton failed to perform in key counties Clinton underperformed Obama — sometimes heavily — in key counties in swing states. For example, Obama beat Romney by more than 381,000 votes in Wayne County, Mich.",left,2016
"Trump's populist,overtly masculine, anti-PC appeal helped him vault past Clinton. With the GOP controlling both theSenateandHouse, the question now is how Trump will square his brand of conservatism with that of his congressional counterparts. Those leery white evangelicals?",left,2016
The numbers were slightly less stark among Democrats — only 82 percent of people who saw Clinton unfavorably chose Trump; 11 percent chose her anyway. Update:This post was updated at 8:32 AM with the section about Trump and Clinton's favorability numbers. This story initially misstated how Trump talked about crimes committed by Mexican immigrants in the country illegally.,left,2016
"The latest totals show Hillary Clinton leading Trump in the popular vote by more than 2 million. Trump tweeted on Sunday afternoon, ""I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."" He did not provide evidence to back up that claim, and Trump's representatives did not immediately respond to a request for more information. In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally Trump's unfounded claim appears to have originated with the website Infowars and radio host Alex Jones, who reported that 3 million people voted illegally, citing flawed evidence.",left,2016

Jones frequently promotes conspiracy theories, including a false story in 2015 that President Obama wasplanning to use special forces to impose martial law in Texasthat got traction with the state's governor for a time.",left,2016
"The fact-checking group also cites multiple reports that show just a handful of anomalous votes in recent years. One investigation ""found just 56 cases of noncitizens voting between 2000 and 2011."" Trump's claims about the popular vote would have no weight, anyway, on whether he won the election since it is decided by the Electoral College. Trump currently has 290 Electoral College votes, according to The Associated Press — well more than the 270 he needs to win the presidency.",left,2016
"Trump currently has 290 Electoral College votes, according to The Associated Press — well more than the 270 he needs to win the presidency. That total is expected to grow when Michigan certifies its vote on Monday.",left,2016
"That total is expected to grow when Michigan certifies its vote on Monday. Trump leads in that state by more than 10,000 votes, and the state's 16 Electoral College votes would push Trump's total over 300. Trump started tweeting on Sunday amid a push for recounts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by Green Party candidate Jill Stein.",left,2016
Trump is troubled by the fact that a growing majority of Americans did not vote for him. His unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd.,left,2016
"Stein's and Clinton's teams cited concerns over the integrity of voting systems, which Trump himself discussed during the campaign. He would often say that the only way he could lose would be if the election was ""stolen,"" and Clinton called Trump's remark in a debate that he might not accept the results if he lost ""horrifying."" Clinton conceded the race to Trump in the early morning hours of Nov.",left,2016
"We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead."" The former Democratic nominee is not pulling back from that position, and her campaign is trying to distinguish between its decision to have legal representatives participate in the Wisconsin recount and actually promoting it, which the campaign says it has not done. ""Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides,"" Marc Elias, the general counsel for Clinton's campaign,wrote Saturday. But Elias also said the campaign had received ""hundreds of messages, emails, and calls urging us to do something, anything, to investigate claims that the election results were hacked and altered in a way to disadvantage Secretary Clinton."" No evidence has emerged to support those claims.",left,2016
"The deadline to formally request a recount in Pennsylvania, where Trump had his biggest margin of victory of the three states in question, is Monday. Michigan appears to be Trump's closest margin of victory, and the state is set to certify its results at 2 p.m. ET on Monday; then, a request for a recount must be submitted by Wednesday.",left,2016
"Trump then finished that sentence with, ""if I win,"" seemingly admitting a strange logic: that a system rigged against him would be totally acceptable if that rigging ultimately worked out in his favor. At Wednesday night's presidential detbate, moderator Chris Wallace asked Trump if he would accept the results of the presidential election.",left,2016
"For weeks, Trump has been claiming the race is rigged in Hillary Clinton's favor, in part because of deceased individuals and immigrants in the country illegally casting votes and election officials throughout the country colluding against Trump. When first asked, Trump refused to say yes, replying in part, ""I will look at it [the election results] at the time."" When pushed on the issue, Trump told Wallace, ""I'll keep you in suspense."" At Thursday's event, Trump went on to expound on why he thinks the election is rigged. He cited Clinton staff emails recently leaked to the public by WikiLeaks, alleging that Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta said that immigrants in the country illegally could vote with just driver's licences.",left,2016

"Bush, orBush v. Gore."" (That election case didn't start until on and after Election Day, unlike Trump, who has started claiming the election is rigged weeks before the the country finishes casting its ballots.) Trump then went on to say that even asking him to accept the results of the election is unfair. ""In effect,"" Trump said, ""I'm being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters."" In his remarks Thursday, Trump seemed to contradict himself on the issue of a rigged election.",left,2016
"""Of course I would accept a clear election result,"" Trump said, appearing to read from a teleprompter, ""but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result. And always I will follow and abide by all of the rules and tradition of all of the many candidates who have come before me."" Before moving on to other topics in his speech, Trump seemed to brush the whole issue off. ""Bottom line, we're gonna win,"" Trump said, ""We're gonna win so big.",left,2016

You know, in that same 1999 interview on NBC's ""Meet The Press,"" Trump was asked about several issues, including same-sex marriage and about what was then a debate around gay people serving in the military.

On the stand, Cohen described a repayment scheme that formed the basis of the 34 counts of falsified business records: 11 falsified invoices, 12 falsified ledger entries and 11 checks falsely recording the repayment as legal “retainers.” Nine of the checks were signed by Trump himself.

...Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign? Clinton also acknowledged that misogyny did play a role in her loss and that she would elaborate on that in her book as well.,left,2016
"""I can't be anything other than who I am,"" Clinton said. She wasn't entirely dismissive of President Trump, though, revealing that she did support his decision last month to launch a missile strike in Syria after the country's president, Bashar Assad, used chemical weapons against his own people. However, Clinton said she was ""not convinced [the strike] really made much of a difference"" and was concerned about possible backroom deals the Trump administration may have made with Russia, notifying Moscow beforehand of the strikes against their ally.",left,2016

At nearly every rally and campaign event, populated largely by whites, Trump spoke to their cultural grievances — and he has continued to do so as president. But what has also been clear is that nonwhites, many of whom have felt like targets of Trump's nationalist and protectionist tendencies, are also aggrieved.A survey by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H.",left,2016
"It does seem that in America today, it is something of a golden age of grievance. One year later It may be hard to believe, but this week marks one year since Trump was elected president of the United States. And it hasn't been the easiest go of it for the 45th president.",left,2016
"As a candidate, Trump had the lowest favorability ratings of anyone ever elected since polling began. And since his ascendancy to the presidency, he has continued along a similar pattern — with thelowest job-approval ratingof any president in modern polling.",left,2016
"According to an average of the polls, Trump stands around 39 percent.",left,2016
"That was right around the time Trump faced widespread criticism forhis response to racial violenceand protests in Charlottesville, Va.

"Rhetorically, Trump certainly hasn't abandoned his base, but what about on policy?",left,2016

"And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it."" Despite that promise, an infrastructure bill hasn't even been introduced — or pushed by the White House, for that matter. What's more, Trump has so far gotten no major legislation through Congress — not a repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act, not a tax overhaul. But he appears to have a long leash with his base, which is willing to blame others — Democrats, Republican leaders — but not the man they voted for for president who is trying to, in their view, ""drain the swamp."" Part of that long leash could be because cultural grievance was more important to his victory than economic issues.",left,2016
"The Atlantic, citing data from the Public Religion Research Institute, reached that conclusion in May: ""In the wake of Trump's surprise win, some journalists, scholars, and political strategists argued that economic anxiety drove these Americans to Trump. Butnew analysis of post-election survey dataconducted by the Public Religion Research Institute andThe Atlanticfound something different: Evidence suggests financially troubled voters in the white working class were more likely to prefer Clinton over Trump.",left,2016
"Besides partisan affiliation, it was cultural anxiety — feeling like a stranger in America, supporting the deportation of immigrants, and hesitating about educational investment — that best predicted support for Trump.",left,2016
"It suggests Trump's most powerful message, at least among some Americans, was about defending the country's putative culture."" Why cultural grievance is so salient Look no further than the NPR poll — 55 percent of whites said they believe discrimination exists against whites, generally. That is even though just 19 percent said they have personallyexperienced discrimination in applying for jobs.",left,2016

""The director is continuing to oversee the day to day operations of the FBI and is actively planning with his team to lead the FBI into next year and beyond,"" an FBI official said in November after the election.",left,2016

"Don Gonyea Donald Trump speaks at a news conference during a trip to the U.S.-Mexico border in Laredo, Texas, in July 2015.LM Otero/APhide caption Donald Trump speaks at a news conference during a trip to the U.S.-Mexico border in Laredo, Texas, in July 2015. After ""Make America Great Again,"" it is perhaps the most common refrain of the Donald Trump campaign. ""I will build a wall!"" And, every time, it's followed by an ironclad guarantee from the candidate: ""And I will make Mexico pay for it."" When asked how, Trump has always been short on details.",left,2016
But now comes a bit more detail — in a memo just over a page long — first reported by theWashington Postandnow postedon the official Trump campaign website. It's still all about leverage.,left,2016
"It's still all about leverage. The memo lays out a three-day plan, using provisions of the Patriot Act, that Trump says will ""compel Mexico to pay for the wall."" The basic argument is this: Billions of dollars in cash are transferred by individuals from the U.S. to Mexico every year.",left,2016
"To keep that from coming to a halt, Mexico must make a one-time payment to the United States of $5 billion to $10 billion. That amount would cover the cost of building a wall that Trump has estimated would carry a price tag of about $8 billion. (Incidentally, that figure that is widely criticized as being far too low.) Day 1:The Trump administration would draw up a ""proposed rule"" stating that no one be allowed to wire money outside the U.S.",left,2016
"to Mexico at nearly $23 billion, so that's close to the amount Trump's memo cites, but the campaign offers no evidence to support a claim that ""The majority of that amount comes from illegal aliens."" (Remittances to Mexico were up almost 14 percent in February, NPR's Carrie Kahn reports from Mexico City, perBBVA Research.) Day 3:Tell Mexico that if it agrees to come up with the cash to pay for the wall, then the ""proposed rule"" will never go into effect. Further, Trump says the U.S. can use tariffs and strict enforcement of existing trade rules.",left,2016
"In short, pay up or risk an all-out trade war with the U.S., writing new punitive measures that Trump says Mexico couldn't bear. President Obama dismissed Trump's plan as politics and ""half-baked."" He called his plan to halt remittances ""impractical"" and said that the U.S.",left,2016
"President Obama dismissed Trump's plan as politics and ""half-baked."" He called his plan to halt remittances ""impractical"" and said that the U.S. wasn't going to track every Western Union package.",left,2016
"""We've got big issues around the world."" (Obama also tried to widen the lens not just on Trump but to the rest of the GOP, hitting ""concerns"" about Ted Cruz's proposals as well.) Mexico is an ally, which the memo asserts in its conclusion ""has taken advantage of us in another way as well: gangs, drug traffickers and cartels have freely exploited our open borders and committed vast numbers of crimes inside the United States. The United States has borne the extraordinary daily cost of this criminal activity."" It closes by saying the U.S.",left,2016
"has the moral high ground, and it's time ""we use it to Make America Great Again."" So far, there's been no official reaction from the Mexican government to all of this, but in the past there have been strong statements in opposition to Trump's calls for the country to pay for a wall. Last month, President Enrique Pena Nieto told theExcelsiornewspaper that there is no scenario under which Mexico would do that.",left,2016
"Fox responded with a vulgar exclamation when asked about Trump's demand, stressing Mexico will not ""pay for that [expletive] wall."" He went on to call Trump a ""crazy guy,"" adding that the billionaire candidate ""should pay for it.",left,2016
"He's got the money."" That was back in February, and, at the time, Trump responded during a GOP debate on CNN, saying, ""The wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me.",left,2016

"UnidosUS' polling found that the top four concerns for Latinos were inflation, jobs and the costs of housing and healthcare. Because Latinos were feeling this pocketbook pinch, Roriguez said he questions to what extent this election represented the unique qualities that Trump has versus an actual realignment of Latino voters. ""It just remains to be seen if what we're going to see from the incoming administration and the new Republican leaders in Congress, if they're going to go further in appealing to the policies that the Latino voters have said in a bipartisan way they support, which include things like comprehensive immigration reform, health care coverage,"" Rodriguez said.",left,2016

"1 in Mechanicsburg, Pa. Donald Trump is once again taking the fight to Democrats and Hillary Clinton. During a week in which the Republican presidential nominee has been attacking Clinton for disparaging half of his supporters as ""deplorables,"" Trump plans to roll out a new proposal that treads deep into the core issues that Clinton and other Democrats regularly campaign on: making child care more accessible and affordable.",left,2016
"In a speech Tuesday evening in suburban Philadelphia, Trump is expected, according to campaign aides, to go into more detail on a proposal he originally laid out last month in a wide-ranging economic speech — allowing parents to deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes.",left,2016
"How the plan works Trump's expanded plan would allow parents to deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes. The campaign says this is focused on ""working and middle-class families,"" though its income caps — $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for couples — far exceed most people's definition of working class.",left,2016
"After his economic speech last month, Trump was criticized for a plan that didn't do anything for those who don't earn enough to pay federal income taxes. They wouldn't be able to take advantage of the deductions, and because child care costs what it costs, it has anoutsize impact on the poor.",left,2016
"To address this, Trump's campaign unveiled child carerebates— up to $1,200, staffers say — to provide benefits to people who currently don't earn enough to pay federal income taxes.",left,2016
"The Trump campaign says that stay-at-home parents would also be eligible for the same tax deductions working parents currently receive. AsCNBC found in its analysiswhen Trump's plan was unveiled last month, Trump's plan ""would create a substantial tax break for working parents, but further widen the deficit."" That's because: ""On average, households with a woman working outside her home and taking care of a child under 15 paid an average $127 a week on child care, according to a Census Bureauanalysisof 2010 data. That works out to about $6,600 a year.",left,2016
"Only 3.5 million tax returns claimed the existing child-care tax credit for the 2010 tax year, according toIRS data, saving those households $1.9 billion. (Nearly 10 million returns claimed a separate tax credit for all parents, whether or not the family had child-care expenses, for another $14 billion in tax savings.) ""So total out-of-pocket child-care costs amounted to about $142 billion, which a Trump administration would either have to make up with higher taxes or add to the budget deficit."" Along with all this, the campaign is now promising to ""guarantee"" six weeks of paidmaternityleave. (Paternity leave is not mentioned.) Clinton's proposal would be open to fathers as well.",left,2016

"Tax-free savings accounts Trump would also create a Dependent Care Savings Account, which would allow ""tax-deductible contributions and tax-free appreciation year-to-year,"" according to a campaign-provided fact sheet. What's more, the government would match half of the first $1,000 deposited per year.",left,2016
"If all of those families put in $1,000 per year, it would cost the government $25 billion annually. Even if half of all families contributed to it, that's still a big price tag, and the Trump campaign outlines no way to pay for it. Not to mention that that kind of benefit doesn't help the families who can't afford to put that much in per year.",left,2016
"Not to mention that that kind of benefit doesn't help the families who can't afford to put that much in per year. Trump campaign policy adviser Stephen Miller told NPR's Sarah McCammon that a Trump administration would focus on fraud to finance the family leave portion. Miller's estimate was $5.3 billion in unemployment insurance fraud, which the campaign believes it can recoup half of.",left,2016
"Miller added, ""The rest is paid for through comprehensive tax and economic reform."" And the campaign believes it would be ""deficit-neutral.""

But Ken Martin said, you know, they always need to run like they're behind so that they don't, you know, come complacent or take for granted what they've been able to do in this state.MCCAMMON: And so if Minnesota sees lower than average turnout, Mara, who does that favor?LIASSON: Well, I guess you'd have to say it favors the Democrats only because they seem to be doing better in these low-turnout races.",left,2016

And like most states across the country where there are large metropolitan areas, like in Minneapolis, Saint Paul or the twin cities, there are suburbs that have shifted more towards a purple or even deep blue in some of the inner ring suburbs of the Twin Cities.And so 1 1/2 percentage points is how close Trump came to winning Minnesota in 2016.

"Clinton has said she's been ""doing her homework."" The Democratic nominee has no more campaign events scheduled before the debate. Her campaign schedule has been purposefully light this week so she has time to prepare, according to Jennifer Palmieri, director of communications for the Clinton campaign. For her prep sessions, Clinton has reportedly surrounded herself with a team of strategists, including Ron Klain, former chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden, and Karen Dunn, a Clinton adviser and former White House aide, according to theWall Street Journal.",left,2016

"""Obviously I will be practicing, but I don't want to put so much practice in that all of a sudden, you're not who you are,"" Trump said. One way Trump may have been preparing already is by giving a number of scripted speeches on the campaign trail in recent weeks, as opposed to the freewheeling style he adopted at rallies through most of the campaign.

"And I'll be honest, I've been telling all of my friends, no matter who they support, no matter what their politics, you should go to a Trump rally...SHIVARAM: Right.KURTZLEBEN: ...If you have the opportunity. Because, first of all, a Trump rally is a way to understand the strength of the bond he has with his crowds, which is so tight, I would argue that it's near unbreakable. It is wildly strong.",left,2016
"It is a personal bond. But the other thing is that to see a Trump rally is to understand a very fundamental truth of American politics right now, which is politics as an identity. And I have never, ever seen a candidate other than Trump that has had this kind of an identity pull over his crowds - like, over how they dress, how they talk, what they think.",left,2016
"But my argument is there's so much more to understand about politics by seeing and experiencing one of these things.SHIVARAM: Yeah. And just for context, Domenico, I mean, most people - most voters are not necessarily experiencing this campaign or Trump's campaign in person. I mean, this is a unique perspective to be at one in person rather than seeing, you know, clips on Twitter or something like that.MONTANARO: Yeah.",left,2016
"They might get into an argument with a family member or something who believes something differently than they do - liberal or conservative - and then sort of maybe shut themselves off and don't have a further understanding of it. But I think Danielle is right that, when you're awash in it at a Trump rally, there's a very different sense and understanding of why there's such a deep connection with Trump.SHIVARAM: So let's get into what you saw, Danielle. You went to the start of the line at this event where people were waiting to get in.",left,2016
"They say Front Row Joes. Trump often calls them out at his rallies.SHIVARAM: Oh.KURTZLEBEN: And so this was her 50th Trump rally in her life. And when you go to any Trump rally, you can see a whole flock of Front Row Joes at them.",left,2016
"But one I also wanted to pull out was Lauren Tucker. This was her first Trump rally. And when I met her, she was maybe 20th in line, but she had one of her kids with her.",left,2016
They were so welcoming. There's very much a sense among Trump voters at their rallies - that they are among their own - right? - that they are part of a similar flock.,left,2016
"And this has kind of the same vibe. But I've been thinking through - OK, what separates Trump fandom from other fandoms, especially nonpolitical fandom - so, like, Taylor Swift or Phish or even a lot of sports fandom? And it's - I mean, the merch is a thing that I really land on - right?",left,2016
"She came with her grandmother. And they were wearing the same shirt, and it said, I'm a Trump girl. I make no apologies.",left,2016
"But I do. I always will.KURTZLEBEN: Like, there's very much this feeling of - you're going to probably get up in my face for being a Trump supporter. And that's part of our identity - is that we get pushback.",left,2016
"That reinforces that I'm right in being a Trump supporter. To me, that - like, you see it on the merch, but that very idea is so central to the Trump identity. I mean, I want to add one more thing.",left,2016
"One quote that really struck me at this rally - it came from Representative Barry Loudermilk. He is a Republican congressman from Georgia, and he was talking about some work he did on a committee that was trying to shift blame away from Trump regarding January 6. And he said this.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARRY LOUDERMILK: You know, doing what is right isn't easy.",left,2016
"To me, that is the fundamental - one of the most fundamental things that makes the bond between Trump and his supporters so strong - is if you try to argue with me, it proves that I'm doing the right thing.MONTANARO: I think going to these kinds of rallies, talking to people who are staunchly pro-Trump really helps you understand why you don't see movement within polling or otherwise to see why or how Trump's supporters move. I also think that this is an example of why it's likely that Trump still has a strong base of support, and his, you know, election numbers aren't very different. His polling numbers haven't really changed very much.",left,2016
"His polling numbers haven't really changed very much. When I'm talking about his favorability ratings, a majority of people don't like Trump, but, you know, a significant number - 45%, 46%, 47% - say they do have a favorable opinion. And you haven't seen that move very much.",left,2016
"And you haven't seen that move very much. And it's why, when you look at 2016 versus 2020, Trump got 46% in 2016, 47% in 2020, and why that's likely to be the same kind of outcome in 2024.SHIVARAM: OK, we're going to take a break. And when we're back, we're going to focus on the message of these rallies.All right, and we're back.",left,2016
"And he's talked about this previously - about the kind of country that he was pointing toward versus the grievance that kind of built up underneath that.KURTZLEBEN: To add onto that - this wasn't at this Rome rally. But a week after that, at a rally in Ohio, Trump really hammered home that sort of us versus them division, especially regarding immigrants. For example, during one part of the speech, Trump went off on a tangent about illegal immigration.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: If I had prisons that were teeming with MS-13 and all sorts of people that they've got to take care of for the next 50 years - right?",left,2016
"I mean, his inauguration speech, let's remember, was about American carnage - something that was very different from what a lot of people were seeing in the country. But Trump has taken this dark vision of the country, often with violent rhetoric attached to it that he's continued to do - I don't know if we can, from a data standpoint, say it's ramped up or not, but he certainly makes it a consistent feature of all of his rallies, especially when it comes to migrants who've come to the country. You know, clearly, January 6, as we noted, happened after 2020, so it's something that he talks about quite a bit more and talking about that.",left,2016
"He's going to be much more front and center the way he was in 2016 and 2020. And does that change the calculus at all for some of these folks who might be upset with President Biden for various policy positions, and do they see Trump as an urgent enough threat to, say, not vote for a third party?SHIVARAM: We're going to leave it here for today. I'm Deepa Shivaram.",left,2016
"But the other thing is that to see a Trump rally is to understand a very fundamental truth of American politics right now, which is politics as an identity. And I have never, ever seen a candidate other than Trump that has had this kind of an identity pull over his crowds - like, over how they dress, how they talk, what they think. They follow him.",left,2016
Absolutely. So I talked to this one woman who sells merch at Trump rallies. Her name is Amber Johnson.,left,2016
"And it's - I mean, the merch is a thing that I really land on - right? - because, when I go to a Trump rally, I often walk by these tables and look at what is being sold. And in addition to the plain-old Make America Great Again hats, you have a lot of really confrontational merch.",left,2016
"This division that comes up from that kind of rhetoric - it is uniquely Trumpian (ph).MONTANARO: Yeah. And this has been an identity of Trump's the entire time, you know, that he's been around. I mean, you know, using immigrants to say that they are, you know, changing the culture of the country is the point that he's trying to make - that there is this, you know, very strongly held white grievance, cultural grievance that Trump knows to play on as there's a demographic change that's been taking place in this country - one that, by the way, the right can't do a whole heck of a lot about, even if you shut down the border today.",left,2016
"And the events that Trump holds have always been a bit different. Danielle, these Trump rallies have been going on and off since the 2016 campaign. I'm curious - why did you want to go deep on one now?KURTZLEBEN: Right.",left,2016
"Trump often calls them out at his rallies.SHIVARAM: Oh.KURTZLEBEN: And so this was her 50th Trump rally in her life. And when you go to any Trump rally, you can see a whole flock of Front Row Joes at them. And there are different groups of people like this who try to go to multiple Trump rallies.",left,2016
"I cover the presidential campaign.MONTANARO: And I'm Domenico Montanaro, senior political editor and correspondent.SHIVARAM: All right, so today we're going to go on a field trip of sorts. As the election heats up, both President Biden and former President Trump are obviously on the road. They're holding rallies to gin up support for their campaigns.",left,2016
"So I've covered a lot of campaign events - right? - but since I came back from maternity leave last fall, I have been covering Trump rally after Trump rally. And I keep coming back from them and saying, look, there's a lot of stuff to report on.",left,2016
"And that's part of our identity - is that we get pushback. That reinforces that I'm right in being a Trump supporter. To me, that - like, you see it on the merch, but that very idea is so central to the Trump identity.",left,2016
"Domenico, let's go back to the way beginning here in terms of how a Trump rally starts. Here's what folks will hear in that room.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING).UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for the horribly and unfairly treated January 6 hostages.UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Singing) Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?DONALD TRUMP: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.SHIVARAM: All right. So for context here, that is the national anthem being sung by people who were imprisoned for their role in attacking the Capitol on January 6.",left,2016
"And this has been going on for years. I'm curious, Domenico, if we can kind of wrap this in here - the political messaging in the years that Trump has been speaking like this and using this strategy from 2015, let's say, to now - has that changed?MONTANARO: I think it's very similar to what we've heard from Trump in previous years. I mean, his inauguration speech, let's remember, was about American carnage - something that was very different from what a lot of people were seeing in the country.",left,2016
"I got there at 6:30 in the morning, and I was a latecomer. But, yes, like, there are, for example, some people who try to make it to as many Trump rallies as possible. The first person I met was a woman named Sharon Anderson.",left,2016
"And people will always try to stop you from doing what's right.KURTZLEBEN: To me, that is it right there. To me, that is the fundamental - one of the most fundamental things that makes the bond between Trump and his supporters so strong - is if you try to argue with me, it proves that I'm doing the right thing.MONTANARO: I think going to these kinds of rallies, talking to people who are staunchly pro-Trump really helps you understand why you don't see movement within polling or otherwise to see why or how Trump's supporters move.

"So for context here, that is the national anthem being sung by people who were imprisoned for their role in attacking the Capitol on January 6. And then, of course, you hear former President Trump there saying the Pledge of Allegiance. What does that all mean here?MONTANARO: You know, this is a potentially insidious technique that Trump is using because, you know, national anthems are the kinds of things that you can use to boost nationalism - to unify when there might be, you know, wedges of disunity that could appear.",left,2016
"What does that all mean here?MONTANARO: You know, this is a potentially insidious technique that Trump is using because, you know, national anthems are the kinds of things that you can use to boost nationalism - to unify when there might be, you know, wedges of disunity that could appear.

And this is a really different turn than we've seen, you know, in past years, obviously.",left,2016
"With the general election happening, very different kind of audience - independents certainly see his actions very differently than Republican voters do. And, you know, it's going to be interesting to see how this sort of changes the dynamic as you start to hear Trump more and more and become part of, again, the mainstream of news that we're going to have to hear about because he's been so out of the picture for the last few years when it comes to his campaigning. He's going to be much more front and center the way he was in 2016 and 2020.",left,2016

That ""glass ceiling"" (a phrase Clinton herself has used often) milestone has been somewhat lost in the drama of this campaign, but is still ""a really important moment in American society,"" political science professor Andra Gillespie of Emory University told NPR earlier this year. ""The impact is just as important for a woman to head the top of a major-party ticket as it was for an African-American to do so eight years ago,"" she said.",left,2016
"""The impact is just as important for a woman to head the top of a major-party ticket as it was for an African-American to do so eight years ago,"" she said. As Gillespie sees it, whoever is at the top of a presidential ticket is ""a metric by which we can talk about how America has diversified, how it has become more inclusive, that you're now letting people who don't fit the traditional white, male model assume positions of leadership in the country."" When Clinton failed to get the Democratic nomination in 2008, she spoke about how her candidacy did put cracks in the ""highest, hardest glass ceiling."" ""Although we weren't able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it's got about 18 million cracks in it,"" she said. ""And the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time."" Her success in the campaign now, Gillespie said, is ""very much a testament to the work that the suffragettes started over 150 years ago.""

"A Different Kind Of 'First' President Obama achieved a ""first"" of another kind — as the first African-American to win the Democratic nomination and be elected president. But Gillespie said Clinton has been free to talk about her ""first"" (gender) in a way Obama was not able to talk about race. Gillespie refers to Obama as a ""de-racialized black politician"" — meaning he shied from emphasizing race in order to appeal to non-black voters.",left,2016
"""When Hillary Clinton says half her Cabinet could be female,"" Gillespie observed, ""I mean, can you imagine what would have happened if [Obama] had said, 'Half of my Cabinet seats are going to go to African-Americans'?"" Clinton's strategy seems to be paying off among women, who haveoverwhelmingly favoredthe candidate in most primary states so far. As NPR's Asma Khalid reported, if the current trajectory continues, Clinton could turn the traditional gender gap into a gender gulf in November. That could be especially true if she goes head to head with GOP front-runner Donald Trump, who has a 70 percentunfavorable rating among women, according to recent national polls.",left,2016

But Hillary Clinton will reach Election Day with the real prospect of becoming the first female president in U.S. history.,left,2016
"She's been a candidate for 19 months. Clinton's official campaign launch was preceded by months of will-she-or-won't-she chatter, but there was lots of work behind the scenes and a ""Ready For Hillary"" superPAC working out in the open to prepare for Clinton to get in. But who would she face?",left,2016
"The crowds at his speeches and rallies kept growing to the point that he was filling sports arenas. As one Democratic activist in Iowa put it to team Clinton, ""Objects in mirror may be closer than they appear."" And those large crowds gave Sanders' campaign more media attention and more credibility. ""You know, sometimes our campaign has been referred to as a fringe campaign.",left,2016
"Clinton barely won the Iowa caucuses and Sanders then trounced her in New Hampshire. That juiced his fundraising, allowing him to run television ads and compete throughout the primary season.",left,2016
"That showed as the primaries moved to southern states where black voters sometimes favored Clinton by 80-point margins, according to exit polls. Sanders also famously let Clinton off the hook on her emails and didn't go after her on making paid speeches to big Wall Street banks, particularly Goldman Sachs, until late in the primary fight.

"Trump's taxes, business dealings, treatment of women and tendency to say and tweet things that hurt him with voters were a constant throughout the general election campaign.

"Elizabeth Warren and even Bernie Sanders campaigned hard for Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine. Clinton won Sanders over by agreeing to modify her debt-free public college proposal to more closely track with Sanders' free college plan.

"At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, delegates began chanting ""lock her up!"" That chant became a regular feature of Trump rallies. Ten days before Election Day, Comey brought the email issue back into the spotlight, announcing emails had been found in the course of another investigation focused on former congressman Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton's closest aide, Huma Abedin. This meant the cloud of Clinton's email server would hang over her campaign from beginning to end, and likely well beyond if she wins.",left,2016
"Another lingering problem for Clinton's campaign came from the speeches she gave behind closed doors to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks. Clinton made millions of dollars on the speaking circuit and the implication was that she was saying something behind closed doors with corporate executives that she wasn't telling voters. By the end of the primary, Sanders regularly called on her to release the transcripts.",left,2016
"Though there were certainly times when this baffled those watching from the outside. And while Clinton was making relatively small promises to small audiences, her campaign was building an infrastructure to reach voters where they were and bring them to the polls. The campaign started early with the slow, hard grind of person-to-person contact known in campaign lingo as organizing.",left,2016
"Organizing isn't flashy. Neither were Clinton's plans and speeches. But rather than fighting against her weaknesses as a campaigner, the campaign played to her strengths.",left,2016
"""This is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,"" Clinton said, echoing an ad called ""Mirrors"" that her campaign had been running in swing states and on national cable leading up to the debate. Trump hit back, making it clear he had seen the ad and didn't much like it.",left,2016

People generally win elections from the center.",left,2016
"It's just that she is running a little bit to the left of where we were on some issues because the country has moved to the left on those issues.CORNISH: But in a way, I feel like that question is almost about was the Obama map some kind of fluke, right? Like, even though we're looking at a president who won two terms, I feel like there's an undercurrent here of, like, that somehow can't be replicated.DIONNE: The Obama map is very much like the map and that elected Bill Clinton with a few states out.

"If you want to be guaranteed to be impossible to do that and have a president that's nonproductive then run on a base mobilization.

"If they split the 694 delegates at stake Tuesday, Clinton will be a couple hundred short.",left,2016

More than a dozen pollsters and public opinion experts worked for months to determine what might have led polls to overestimate Clinton's support.,left,2016
"They found that state-level polls were particularly far off from the final election results, leading many forecasters to overestimate Clinton's chances of winning.

"Predictions from some of the most popular models (FiveThirtyEight and theNew York Times' Upshot, for example) ranged from giving Clinton a 71 percent to 99 percent chance of winning. So when she lost, everyone (including NPR) tried to answer the question: Why did polls — and, therefore, forecasting models — so often point to a Clinton win? First of all, only some polls were off, and it wasn't the national polls.",left,2016
"First of all, only some polls were off, and it wasn't the national polls. Clinton won the popular vote by 2.1 percentage points, and polls had her winning the popular vote by an average of 3 points. That's not much of a gap at all, compared with past presidential polling.",left,2016
"This is where the researchers drilled down into the whys of what went wrong. Late deciders in swing states ended up going significantly pro-Trump Part of the discrepancy between votes and polls was that voters did change their minds late — but it wasn't necessarily because of Comey. The decline in Clinton's support, the report finds, may have begun as early as Oct.",left,2016

"In particular, the authors point out, the data show a U-shape in 2012 — people with high school diplomas only and postgrad degrees tended to vote more Democratic that year, while people in the middle (with college degrees or some college) were less Democratic. In 2016, it was more linear: The lowest-educated people were relatively more likely to vote for Trump. Among higher-educated groups, people were more likely to vote for Clinton, with postgraduates by far the most likely to vote for her.",left,2016
"Among higher-educated groups, people were more likely to vote for Clinton, with postgraduates by far the most likely to vote for her. The problem is that pollsters didn't account for that, Kennedy said.",left,2016

"It's a story that's not completely told."" What probably didn't affect the polls (much) ""Shy Trump voters"" came up a lot in the run-up to the election, referring to the worry that Trump voters were reluctant to tell a live pollster that they supported him. That doesn't appear to be true.",left,2016
"""The committee tested that hypothesis in five different ways,"" said Kennedy. ""And each test yielded either no evidence whatsoever to support that hypothesis or weak evidence."" If there were this ""shy Trump voter"" effect, the authors wrote, there should be some sort of evidence that robopolls (that is, automated phone polls) and Internet polls consistently showed Trump doing better than the phone polls, for example. That didn't happen.",left,2016
"That didn't happen. Robopolls did tend to show Trump with better support than in live-phone polls, but Internet-only polls tended to show him doing worse. One other issue that didn't seem to matter much was ""nonresponse bias."" This is the idea that certain groups will respond to polls more often than others, thus biasing the results.",left,2016
"As explained above, some groups (like less educated Americans) often participate in polls less than others. But when the researchers broke this down by geography, they did not find that pro-Trump areas were any less likely to be represented, on average, than pro-Clinton areas. Furthermore, they didn't find that the relatively correct national polls were right just because Clinton- and Trump-favoring polls nationwide canceled each other out.",left,2016
"For that reason, they propose a greater investment in state-level polling: ""Well-resourced survey organizations might have enough common interest in financing some high quality state-level polls so as to reduce the likelihood of another black eye for the profession."" And one more thing: The researchers wag a collective finger at election forecasters, saying that ""they helped crystalize the belief that Clinton was a shoo-in for president, with unknown consequences for turnout."" What to do about that is unclear — even some of the people producing those forecasts advised caution.",left,2016

These so-called ""call sheets,"" according to State Department spokesperson John Kirby, appear to have been inadvertently classified at the confidential level.

He thinks the president should try to portray his opponent as old, prone to gaffes and someone who, even before the pandemic, didn't campaign as rigorously as some of his primary opponents did.

"Updated at 6:30 p.m. ET Shortly after The Associated Press and multiple networks called the presidential election for former Vice President Joe Biden, President Trump released a statement claiming the election was ""far from over,"" falsely accusing President-elect Biden of attempting to undermine the electoral process and vowing to take the election to the courts. Trump was at his golf course in Virginia when a slew of networksannounced Biden had won the presidency.",left,2020
"Biden leads in Georgia, while Trump has the edge in North Carolina, neither of which have been called by the AP; neither state would swing the result of the election at this point. Counting also continues in Arizona, which the AP called for Biden earlier in the week and where Biden maintains a narrow edge. In his statement, Trump reiterated baseless claims that votes are being counted improperly.",left,2020
"""The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor."" Many of those lawsuits focus on questions of transparency and access to observe vote counting — for instance, disputing how far away an election observer can stand from officials. It is not clear how such a legal challenge could shift the results of the election.",left,2020
"Just a few hours earlier, the president had falsely tweeted that he had won the election, a message flagged by Twitter. It should be noted that concession speeches don't have any legal force, and Biden will be the next president regardless of whether Trump concedes or not. On Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi referred to Biden as ""president-elect."" ""How exciting it is to come before you today with Joe Biden having the tremendous mandate that he has,"" she told reporters on Capitol Hill.",left,2020

"ET Democrats go into the final weeks of the presidential campaign with a cash advantage. As of the beginning of this month, former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign, combined with the Democratic Party, had about $30 million more in the bank than President Trump's reelection effort and the Republican Party, according to campaign finance filingsmade public Sunday evening. Adding in joint fundraising committees extends Democrats' financial advantage.",left,2020

"That's a reversal. Trump started raising money for his 2020 effort unusually early — at the start of his presidency — and he maintained an advantage over Biden in terms of cash on hand through the early part of the summer.

"His campaign and the Republican National Committee spent almost all the money they took in during August, though they were still outspent by Biden's campaign and the Democratic National Committee, according to the filings. These documents offer only a partial picture of spending since certain committees working with the campaigns are required to file only quarterly.",left,2020
"Trump's campaign bought no ads on local TV in Pennsylvania, Michigan and New Hampshire, and was outspent by Biden significantly in Florida, North Carolina and Wisconsin. August was the first full month with Bill Stepien as Trump's campaign manager.

"In his first year in office, Biden unnecessarily alienated the Saudis before realizing that they are an indispensable partner in the Middle East. He also presided over a chaotic withdrawal of our troops from Afghanistan (right policy, abysmal execution).",right,2020
"When this predictably antagonized the Russians, the Biden administration doubled down at every turn, insisting that “NATO’s door is open, and will remain open” with respect to Ukraine. Biden himself baited Russia when he said he didn’t “accept anybody’s red lines.” After the invasion, there was still a chance to stop the war in its early weeks before much loss of life and destruction had occurred.",right,2020
"But the Biden administration rejected that deal as well as General Milley’s advice to seek a diplomatic solution in November 2022. As the war of attrition grinds on, the Ukrainians face ever-mounting casualties and infrastructure damage.",right,2020
"Still, President Biden keeps allowing the conflict to escalate and risk World War III.",right,2020
"Every escalation that Biden initially resisted – Abrams tanks, F-16’s, ATACMs, allowing Ukraine to hit targets in Russia – he has eventually acquiesced to.",right,2020
"With Biden, our choices are limited to fighting the proxy war to the last Ukrainian, or fighting Russia ourselves. President Trump has said he wants the dying in Ukraine to stop, and that he will seek to end the war through a negotiated settlement. Ukraine will no longer be able to get the deal we talked them out of in April 2022, but we can still save Ukraine as an independent nation and avert world war.",right,2020
This was the preferred policy under President Trump.,right,2020
"What Biden ushered in was a de facto open border policy. On his first day in office, he repealed President Trump’s executive orders restricting illegal immigration and stopped construction of a border wall, selling off parts of it for scrap metal. This quickly resulted in a massive spike in illegal border crossings and a chaotic and dangerous situation on our southern border.",right,2020
"President Biden (along with the hapless Kamala Harris and the malevolent Homeland Security Chief Alejandro Mayorkas) responded to growing concerns by gaslighting the American public, saying there was no problem at the border despite constant videos of masses of people sprinting across it. When the situation became too dire to ignore or deny, Biden claimed he didn’t have the executive authority to do anything about it and blamed Republicans for not sending him legislation. But this week, facing abysmal polling numbers on this issue, Biden suddenly discovered he has executive authority after all.",right,2020

If he wins a second term, the open border policy will resume, and tens of millions more illegals will stream across the border.",right,2020
"Yet Biden has pushed for selective and unprecedented prosecutions of his once and future opponent from the moment he assumed office.

A quick look at the evolution of the USD under the last 4 US presidents shows that, despite imposing tariffs for the first time since the world became globalized, the last Trump presidency saw a decline of around 9.0% in the USD index. In contrast,the weaponization of USD assets under the Bidenadministration resulted in an increase of over 15% in the USD index, as investors, despite the ongoing ‘de-dollarization’ environment, continued to allocate assets within the USD system to preserve their wealth from the destruction associated with the wars initiated in Eastern Europe and the Middle East during Biden's tenure.",right,2020

Consequently, the Democrats, under the influence of neocons who are unelected and disregard the constitution, could carry outa coup,suspend the election, and seize control of the country, similar to what Zelensky did in Ukraine under the same rationale.",right,2020
"After that, Joe Biden would only need toresign as president on January 20thor before, likely arguing that he is not physically or mentally fit to be a ""War President."" This wouldmake Kamala Harris the ‘de facto president’of the US, fulfilling the requirement to transfer power before January 21st of the year following the 4-year election cycle. While US laws require a lengthy process involving the President, House, and Senate, often needing bipartisan support, presidents can also govern via executive orders, which carry the force of law but only bind the executive branch.",right,2020
"That’sa lotof ignorant bullshit packed tight into a single paragraph: · The “pandemic” never “controlled our lives.” The social, economic, and psychological costs were imposed by legal fiat and corporate state media terror campaigns. · Where did the exploding cancer rates that now allegedly require COVID shots to fix come from, Trump? · Vaccines require 10-15 years of development because they kill peopleen massewhen they’re rushed through in nine months in the back of said corporate state media terror campaigns and a society held hostage by the government Related:The Biomedical State’s Crimes Against Humanity Cannot Go Unpunished People sometimes bristle at my refusal to full-throatedly embrace Trump without reservation.",right,2020
"Is he markedly better than Biden — and, more importantly, are the people he’s likely to surround himself with, on balance, better than those around the Brandon entity? Yes.",right,2020
Here’s a modest proposal: I’ll relentlessly shill for Trump with no qualifications once he ceases bragging about his complicity in the greatest crime in human history. Or is that too high of a bar for the former president to clear?,right,2020
"We all know of our utter worthlessness to the well-heeled, especially the ruling elites. Now, as President Joe Biden mulls (or drools with a blank stare) over green-lighting a clown dictator’s use of American and British long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia, the multitudes are shocked! For many of us, however, the atomic clock will soon be at 1 second to midnight.",right,2020

"It warns those at risk of future heart failure due to 'persistent infection of SARS-CoV-2 (Covis-19) is expected to exponentially increase'.” The Brandon entity’s abysmal poll numbers as an incumbent president are so deep underwater that it’s literally statistically impossible, based on years of polling precedent, for him to win in 2024 barring widespread vote-rigging that would make 2020 look like itreallywas the most “secure election in history.” It’s no wonder, then, that his media tools are grasping at straws for something,anythingto sell the public on his presidency. Democrat strategist Simon Rosenberg, in that pursuit, is drawing yet again from the COVID well Groundhog Day-style: “The central promise of Biden in 2020 was that he was going to get us through COVID and get us to the other side successfully. That’s really what the election was litigated on when you look back at polling and look at the election in 2020.",right,2020
And I think on that central promise Joe Biden has been successful. He did what he said he was gonna do.,right,2020
"As soon as Fani Willis’s own conduct threw the entire lawfare campaign against Donald Trump, years in the making, into doubt, the ethnonarcissist whining came tumbling out immediately: Criticizing a prosecutor for corruptly staffing her loser boyfriend onto a job he wasn’t qualified for was racist!
