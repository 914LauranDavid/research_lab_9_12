"By Liz Halloran Hours after Republicans captured the  House of Representatives and  slashed the Democratic majority in the  Senate, a subdued President  Obama said in  a White House  news conference that voters were mostly preoccupied with  the slow economic recovery. Obama  would not concede that a Republican election rout marked a  massive repudiation of his agenda, but he did shoulder the blame for deep  voter frustration over the economy.Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Imageshide caption A sober President Obama acknowledged Wednesday that he took ""a shellacking"" in the midterm election and that his once highflying relationship with the American voter had hit rocky times.",left,2012

""There is an inherent danger in being in the White House and being in the bubble,"" said the president, whose party on Tuesday lost control of the House in a historic Republican wave.",left,2012
"Democrats barely clung to their Senate majority. ""The responsibilities of this office are so enormous,"" Obama said, that ""sometimes we lose track of the ways that we connected with folks that got us here in the first place."" Working With Republicans The president, who drew comparisons with midterm losses suffered by presidents Reagan and Clinton during their first terms, pledged to work with GOP leaders on issues ranging from tax cuts to modest forward movement on energy policy, But he warned Republicans that while frustrated voters may have spurned him and his party, they want to move forward and not ""relitigate"" the past two years. GOP leaders, including House Speaker-in-waiting John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, clearly disagree: They say they are poised to immediately start overhauling the recent health care legislation.",left,2012
"At a Wednesday morning press conference, Boehner referred to the health care initiative as a ""monstrosity"" that needs to be replaced. McConnell said voters sent a message that they want to stop Obama's agenda. Republican leaders say they are committed to a smaller government and have called for discretionary spending to be curtailed to 2008 levels.",left,2012
"Obama defended his administration's initiatives -- from the economic stimulus package to the auto industry bailout, as well as the health care bill -- as tough decisions that were ""right for moving the country forward."" ""It's understandable that folks said to themselves, maybe this is the agenda as opposed to a response to an emergency,"" he said, and viewed it as an overreach with the ""price tags that went with that."" He suggested that Americans would have been more confident in the administration's actions if the nation's unemployment rate was 5 percent now instead of 9.6 percent. While legislative gridlock seems likely going into the 2012 presidential campaign, Obama listed several areas that he believes Democrats and Republicans may find common ground.",left,2012

Republicans are looking to permanently extend Bush tax cuts for wealthier Americans; Democrats -- including Obama -- have sought to end those cuts, but extend tax cuts for the middle class. The president Wednesday appeared newly open to negotiation.",left,2012

"But first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that you'd like to ask the president directly about something he just said?",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, sure.",left,2012
"President. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, I think — let's talk about taxes because I think it's instructive. Now, four years ago when I stood on this stage I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families.",left,2012
"They can buy a computer for their kid who's going off to college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits and then hire more workers. Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper income individuals can — are currently taking advantage of — if you take those all away — you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.,left,2012
"And that's why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the deficit — or — or — or not adding to the deficit, is by burdening middle-class families.",left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:Well -- MR. LEHRER:Let's just stay on taxes for -- MR.,left,2012
"LEHRER:Let's just stay on taxes for -- MR. ROMNEY:But I — but I — right, right. MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Yeah. Well, but — but -- MR.",left,2012
ROMNEY:— virtually every — virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.,left,2012
"LEHRER:All right, go -- MR. ROMNEY:So — so if — if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not. I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut.",left,2012
So there's no economist can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds 5 trillion (dollars) if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.,left,2012
ROMNEY:This is about getting jobs for the American people. MR.,left,2012
"Do you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan? PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, for 18 months he's been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is ""never mind."" And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you describe, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class.",left,2012
"It's arithmetic. Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times.",left,2012
"Now, under — under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they're the job creators. They'd be burdened.",left,2012
"They'd be burdened. But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Jim, let me just come back on that — on that point.",left,2012
LEHRER:Just for the — just for the record -- MR. ROMNEY:These small businesses we're talking about -- MR. LEHRER:Excuse me.,left,2012
ROMNEY:Yeah. MR.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:It's fun, isn't it? MR.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:That's OK. MR.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:You bet. Well, President, you're — Mr.",left,2012
"That's by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Jim, I — you may want to move on to another topic, but I would just say this to the American people. If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for — $7 trillion, just to give you a sense, over 10 years that's more than our entire defense budget — and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney's plan may work for you.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Jim, I — you may want to move on to another topic, but I would just say this to the American people. If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for — $7 trillion, just to give you a sense, over 10 years that's more than our entire defense budget — and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney's plan may work for you. But I think math, common sense and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth.",left,2012
The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word, so I'm going to take it.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Well, but — but he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word of that segment, I hope.",left,2012
Let me just make this comment. PRESIDENT OBAMA:(Chuckles.) He can — you can have it. He can -- MR.,left,2012
ROMNEY:First of all -- MR.,left,2012
ROMNEY:Let me — let me repeat — let me repeat what I said — (inaudible).,left,2012
"So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that's not my plan. PRESIDENT OBAMA:OK. MR.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Number two, let's look at history. My plan is not like anything that's been tried before.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:It's just — it's — we've got — we got — when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today. Economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.",left,2012
"This is, theoretically now, a second segment still on the economy, and specifically on what do about the federal deficit, the federal debt. And the question — you each have two minutes on this — and, Governor Romney you go first because the president went first on segment one. And the question is this: What are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, good. I'm glad you raised that.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:I like it.,left,2012
ROMNEY:Good.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:When I walked in the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion dollar deficit greeting me, and we know where it came from.",left,2012
"And Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that's how the commission — bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it — in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts.",left,2012
And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have. Let — let me just finish this point because you're looking for contrast.,left,2012
"You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination, and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue, and he said no.",left,2012
"It means that — Governor Romney talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities -- MR.",left,2012
"LEHRER:Mr. President, I'm sorry -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:And that is not a right strategy for us to move forward. MR.",left,2012
LEHRER:Way over the two minutes. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Sorry. MR.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.",left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:I have my own plan. It's not the same as Simpson- Bowles.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it; and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan, (a balanced ?) -- MR.",left,2012
ROMNEY:But you've been — but you've been president four years.,left,2012
ROMNEY:OK.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, we've had this discussion before.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:There has to be revenue in addition to cuts.,left,2012
"Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Absolutely. PRESIDENT OBAMA:OK, so -- MR.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:OK, so -- MR. LEHRER:Completely?",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:I — look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes. That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget.",left,2012
"You've got to have -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:If we're serious, we've got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes.",left,2012
"Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get.",left,2012
"When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue-neutral way, close loopholes, deductions — he hasn't identified which ones they are — but thereby bring down the corporate rate.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Jim, let's — we — we've gone on a lot of topics there, and — so I've got to take — it's going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools to -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:(Inaudible.) MR.",left,2012
ROMNEY:— oil to tax breaks and companies overseas.,left,2012
"And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years. Now -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:It's time to end it. MR.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:And — and in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world. Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives, and you say Exxon and Mobil — actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.",left,2012
ROMNEY:But the — the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.,left,2012
LEHRER:Let's have -- MR. ROMNEY:What we do have right now is a setting -- MR. LEHRER:Excuse me.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:— where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country. And finally, Medicaid to states, I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year plus inflation — inflation — plus 1 percent.",left,2012
ROMNEY:But — but the right — the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance -- MR.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:— of our people and states, not the federal government.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:OK. MR.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:You know, I suspect that on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position.",left,2012
"LEHRER:Sure — it — you bet. PRESIDENT OBAMA:— of our deficits right now. You know, my grandmother, some of you know, helped to raise me.",left,2012
"First, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements. MR.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs. And I know any time we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to change their life for the worst, and the answer is, neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:I don't.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Again, that's for future people -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:I understand. MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:— right, not for current retirees.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:— right, not for current retirees. PRESIDENT OBAMA:For — for — so if you're — if you — you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen, because this — this will affect you. The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors, and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.",left,2012
"Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it.",left,2012
ROMNEY:What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare and the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.,left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:So that's — that's number one. MR.,left,2012
ROMNEY:Number two is for people coming along that are young.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Jim, if I — if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative cost than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it. And private insurers have to make a profit.",left,2012
"And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that, and if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is is that the money has to come from somewhere. And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:— but — but overall.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:And so -- MR. ROMNEY:That's — that's a big topic.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:And so -- MR. ROMNEY:That's — that's a big topic. Could we — could we stay on Medicare?,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:Is that a — is that a separate topic? I'm sorry.,left,2012
ROMNEY:Let's get back to Medicare.,left,2012
LEHRER:— before we leave the economy -- MR. ROMNEY:Let's get back to Medicare. MR.,left,2012
ROMNEY:The president said that the government can provide the service at lower -- MR.,left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:— cost and without a profit. MR.,left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase. But my experience -- MR.",left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:My experience is the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost. MR.,left,2012
ROMNEY:Absolutely.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:Yes.,left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:Regulation is essential. You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.,left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:In some places, yes, in other places, no. MR.",left,2012
ROMNEY:It can become out of date.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, I would repeal it and replace it.",left,2012
"LEHRER:Well, here's a specific — let's — excuse me -- MR. ROMNEY:Let me mention the other one. Let's talk the -- MR.",left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:OK. MR.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, I think this is a great example.",left,2012
"Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, and, you know, I appreciate, and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation, but in the past, Governor Romney has said he just wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, roll it back.",left,2012
"Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate. But that's not what I believe.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:(Inaudible) — sorry, Jim. That — that's just not — that's just not the facts.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:Yeah. MR.,left,2012
ROMNEY:That — that's why I'd have regulation.,left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:— have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties. Except they didn't ever go on to define what a qualified mortgage was.",left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:It's been two years. We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet.,left,2012
ROMNEY:— because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. It's not that Dodd- Frank always was wrong with too much regulation.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our — of our marketplace and our businesses, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs. MR.",left,2012
"And you go first, Governor Romney. You wanted repeal.",left,2012
ROMNEY:I sure do.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, four years ago when I was running for office I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about.",left,2012
"LEHRER:Two minutes -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:— before -- MR. LEHRER:Two minutes is up, sir.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:No, I — I think I've — I had five seconds before you interrupted me — was — (laughter) — that the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model. And as a consequence, people are covered there.",left,2012
LEHRER:Your five -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:— leaving millions of people out in the cold.,left,2012
"LEHRER:Your five seconds went away a long time ago. (Laughter.) PRESIDENT OBAMA:That -- MR. LEHRER:All right, Governor.",left,2012
"Governor, tell the — tell the president directly why you think what he just said is wrong about ""Obamacare."" MR. ROMNEY:Well, I did with my first statement. PRESIDENT OBAMA:You did.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, I did with my first statement. PRESIDENT OBAMA:You did. MR.",left,2012
ROMNEY:But I'll go on.,left,2012
ROMNEY:But I'll go on. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Please elaborate. MR.,left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:I'll elaborate. Exactly right.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan idea.,left,2012
"And Governor Romney, at the beginning of this debate, wrote and said, what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation. And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan.",left,2012
"It — when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example — unelected board that we've created — what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall, because the — there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the trend line.",left,2012
Governor Romney says we should replace it.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Let — well, actually — actually it's — it's — it's a lengthy description, but number one, pre-existing conditions are covered under my plan.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:No, it isn't.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:In my opinion, the government is not effective in — in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the costs than the government will ever be.",left,2012
Intermountain Health Care does it superbly well. PRESIDENT OBAMA:They do. MR.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others. But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have.",left,2012
"The private market and individual responsibility always work best. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Let me just point out, first of all, this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given. That's explicitly prohibited in the law.",left,2012
"But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan he would be able to cover people with pre-existing conditions.",left,2012
And that doesn't help the millions of people out there with pre-existing conditions. There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasn't a government takeover of health care.,left,2012
"But when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced, and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts is because there isn't a better way of dealing with the pre-existing conditions problem, it — it just reminds me of — you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan.",left,2012
"And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?",left,2012
"ROMNEY:No, I — I have to respond to that -- MR.",left,2012
"LEHRER:No, but -- MR. ROMNEY:— which is — which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and — and lay down a piece of legislation and say it's my way or the highway, I don't get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago.",left,2012
"President — do you believe there's a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government? PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, I definitely think there are differences. MR.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe.,left,2012
"In fact, we've seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, first, I love great schools.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:(Inaudible) -- MR. ROMNEY:We know that the path we're taking is not working.,left,2012
ROMNEY:We know that the path we're taking is not working.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, the primary responsibility for education is — is of course at the state and local level. But the federal government also can play a very important role.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, as I've indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play.",left,2012
"MR. LEHRER:Do you think you have a difference with your views and those of Governor Romney on — about education and the federal government? PRESIDENT OBAMA:You know, this is where budgets matter because budgets reflect choices.",left,2012
"LEHRER:Do you think you have a difference with your views and those of Governor Romney on — about education and the federal government? PRESIDENT OBAMA:You know, this is where budgets matter because budgets reflect choices. So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it, we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.",left,2012
"So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it, we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference. You know, his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about.",left,2012
"So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it, we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference. You know, his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about. And it wasn't very detailed.",left,2012
"And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training programs -- MR. LEHRER:Do you agree, Governor?",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:Let — let — let me just finish the point.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Oh, yeah.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:I suspect it'll be a small agreement. MR.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:It's going over well in my state, by the way, yeah.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:It's going over well in my state, by the way, yeah. PRESIDENT OBAMA:The — where their partnering so that — they're designing training programs, and people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they complete them. That makes a big difference.",left,2012
"And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference. Governor Romney, I genuinely believe, cares about education. But when he tells a student that, you know, you should borrow money from your parents to go to college, you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver just don't have that option.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Jim, Jim -- MR. LEHRER:I'm certainly going give you a chance to respond to that.",left,2012
ROMNEY:Mr. — Mr.,left,2012
"LEHRER:All right, gentlemen, look -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:Jim, I — (inaudible) -- MR. LEHRER:Excuse me, one sec — excuse, me sir.",left,2012
"(Laughter.) We've got — we've got — barely have three minutes left. I'm not going to grade the two of you and say you've — your answers have been too long or I've done a poor job -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:You've done a great job, Jim. MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Jim, I had the great experience — it didn't seem like it at the time — of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat, and that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:We — as president, I will sit down on day one — actually the day after I get elected, I'll sit down with leaders — the Democratic leaders as well as Republican leaders and — as we did in my state. We met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the — in the — in our state, in that case.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal ""Obamacare,"" which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them.",left,2012
"And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.",left,2012
"Governor Romney, you won the toss, and you elected to go last.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, Jim, I want to thank you and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think this was a terrific debate and I very much appreciate it. And I want to thank the University of Denver.",left,2012
And that's probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I've kept.,left,2012
"MR. LEHRER:Governor Romney, your two-minute closing. MR.",left,2012

"MR. ROMNEY:Well, what you're seeing in this country is 23 million people struggling to find a job, and a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long, long time.

But they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work.",left,2012

PRESIDENT OBAMA:OK. All right.,left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:That was a statement. I don't think — (chuckles) — the American people believe that.,left,2012
ROMNEY:Those things will get us the energy we need.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, think about what the governor — think about what the governor just said.",left,2012
Because the economy was on the verge of collapse; because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney is now promoting.,left,2012
"Because the economy was on the verge of collapse; because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney is now promoting. So it's conceivable that Governor Romney could bring down gas prices, because with his policies we might be back in that same mess. (Audience murmurs.) What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong and at the same time produce energy.",left,2012
"And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about, we've — we've built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire Earth once.",left,2012
"So for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says these are imaginary jobs, when you've got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado who are working, creating wind power, with good- paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator in that — in Iowa is all for it, providing tax credits to help this work and Governor Romney says, I'm opposed, I'd get rid of it, that's not an energy strategy for the future.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:No, he — he gets the first — he actually got — he actually got the first question. So I get the last question — last answer on that one.",left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:Actually -- MS. CROWLEY:But I'm going to give you a chance here.,left,2012

"ROMNEY:Hi, Mary. Q: Governor Romney, you have stated that if you're elected president, you would plan to reduce the tax rates for all the tax brackets and that you would work with the Congress to eliminate some deductions in order to make up for the loss in revenue. Concerning the — these various deductions — the mortgage deduction, the charitable deductions, the child tax credit and also the — oh, what's that other credit?",left,2012
(Laughter.) PRESIDENT OBAMA:You're doing great.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Thank you very much. And — and let me tell you, you — you're absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down, I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:My philosophy on taxes has been simple, and that is, I want to give middle-class families, and folks who are striving to get in the middle class, some relief, because they have been hit hard over the last decade, over the last 15, over the last 20 years. So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one — actually, it was a town hall — and I said I would cut taxes for middle-class families, and that's what I've done by $3,600.",left,2012
"The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent. But what I've also said is for above 250,000 (dollars), we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was president, we created 23 million new jobs.",left,2012
"It will be good for our economy, and it will be good for job creation. Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy. He was on ""60 Minutes"" just two weeks ago, and he was asked, is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 a year?",left,2012
"And when Governor Romney stands here after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary, he stood onstage and said, I'm going to give tax cuts — he didn't say tax rate cuts; he said tax cuts — to everybody, including the top 1 percent, you should believe him, because that's been his history. And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's thriving for everybody.",left,2012
"CROWLEY:Governor Romney, I'm sure you've got a reply there.",left,2012
ROMNEY:(Chuckles.) You're absolutely right.,left,2012

"Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs, even though the military's not asking for them.",left,2012
"Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, of course they add up.",left,2012
"So for instance, when he says, yours is a $5 trillion cut, well, no, it's not, because I'm offsetting some of the reductions with holding down some of the deductions and — and this -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:Candy -- MS.",left,2012
"CROWLEY:Governor, I got to — I got to -- MR. ROMNEY:I'm — and I've told you — yeah. MS.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:And I just — and I just described to you, Mr.",left,2012

"Earlier Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people. Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that's exactly what we've done.",left,2012
"CROWLEY:Governor Romney, pay equity for women. MR.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Thank you. And — important topic and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the — the chance to pull together a Cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men.",left,2012
ROMNEY:I'm going to help women in America get — get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it, he said, I'll get back to you. And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.",left,2012
(Inaudible) — a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.,left,2012
"This is money out of that family's pocket. Governor Romney not only opposed it; he suggested that, in fact, employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage. That's not the kind of advocacy that women need.",left,2012
"That's not the kind of advocacy that women need. When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood for not just contraceptive care. They rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.",left,2012
"President -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:And I've got two daughters, and I want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anybody's sons have.",left,2012
"And Governor, it's for you. Q: Governor Romney, I am an undecided voter because I'm disappointed with the lack of progress I've seen in the last four years. However, I do attribute much of America's economic and international problems to the failings and missteps of the Bush administration.",left,2012
ROMNEY:Great. Thank you.,left,2012

The timekeepers are all working. PRESIDENT OBAMA:All right. MS.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:I — I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not, and I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Governor, that's not true. MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Let me come back and — and — and answer your question. The — President Bush and I are different people, and these are different times.",left,2012
President Bush didn't. President Obama was right. He said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.,left,2012
"President. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, first of all, I think it's important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I started.",left,2012
"And the plans that I talked about will create even more. But when Governor Romney says that he has very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts. That's what took us from surplus to deficit.",left,2012
"That's what took us from surplus to deficit. When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China and is currently investing in countries — in — in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks. That's — Governor, you're the last person who's going to get tough on China.",left,2012
"When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist, that it wouldn't be helpful to American workers. Well, in fact we saved a thousand jobs, and that's the kind of tough trade actions that are required.",left,2012
"You know, there are some things where Governor Romney's different from George Bush. George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a voucher.",left,2012
"So there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they're not on economic policy. In some ways, he's gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy, and I think that's a mistake.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, we've gone through a tough four years; there's no doubt about it.",left,2012
"And those that I haven't been able to keep, it's not for lack of trying, and we're going to get it done in a second term. But you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney's made some commitments as well, and I suspect he'll keep those, too. You know, when members of the Republican Congress say, we're going to sign a no tax pledge so that we don't ask a dime from millionaires and billionaires to reduce our deficit so we can still invest in education and helping kids go to college, he said, me too.",left,2012
"President, let me let -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:And the choice in this election is going to be whose promises are going to be more likely to help you in your life, make sure your kids can go to college, make sure that you are getting a good-paying job, making sure that Medicare and Social Security will be there for you.",left,2012
ROMNEY:I think you know better. I — I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the president just described and that you don't feel like you're confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.,left,2012
"I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get.",left,2012

That's a question I think the — the president will have a chance to answer right now. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Good. I look forward to it.,left,2012
"And what I've also said is, for young people who come here, brought here oftentimes by their parents, have gone to school here, pledged allegiances to the flag, think of this as their country, understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers, then we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship, and that's what I've done administratively. Now, Governor Romney just said that, you know, he wants to help those young people, too. But during the Republican primary, he said, I will veto the DREAM Act that would allow these young people to have access.",left,2012

"The — the oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get. Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money when they're making money every time you go to the pump?",left,2012
"My attitude is if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it. When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue-neutral way, close loopholes, deductions — he hasn't identified which ones they are — but thereby bring down the corporate rate. Well, I want to do the same thing, but I've actually identified how we can do that.",left,2012

MR. ROMNEY:— oil to tax breaks and companies overseas. So let's go through them one by one.,left,2012
Now -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:It's time to end it.,left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:And — and in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world. Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives, and you say Exxon and Mobil — actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.",left,2012
ROMNEY:But the — the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case. MR.,left,2012
ROMNEY:What we do have right now is a setting -- MR. LEHRER:Excuse me.,left,2012
ROMNEY:— where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.,left,2012
ROMNEY:But — but the right — the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance -- MR.,left,2012

"LEHRER:We'll follow up on this. First, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements. MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future. And the essence of the plan is that he would turn Medicare into a voucher program.",left,2012
LEHRER:And you — and you don't support that? PRESIDENT OBAMA:I don't. And — and let me explain why.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Again, that's for future people -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:I understand. MR.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:— right, not for current retirees. PRESIDENT OBAMA:For — for — so if you're — if you — you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen, because this — this will affect you.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:For — for — so if you're — if you — you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen, because this — this will affect you. The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors, and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.",left,2012
"The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year. Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it. But there's still a problem, because what happens is those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors.",left,2012
ROMNEY:What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare and the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program. MR.,left,2012
ROMNEY:So that's — that's number one. MR.,left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:Number two is for people coming along that are young. What I'd do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan — their choice.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Jim, if I — if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative cost than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it. And private insurers have to make a profit.",left,2012
"Nothing wrong with that; that's what they do. And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that, and if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is is that the money has to come from somewhere. And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:— but — but overall. MR.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:And so -- MR.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:And so -- MR. ROMNEY:That's — that's a big topic. Could we — could we stay on Medicare?,left,2012
Could we — could we stay on Medicare? PRESIDENT OBAMA:Is that a — is that a separate topic? I'm sorry.,left,2012

ROMNEY:OK. MR.,left,2012
"LEHRER:Let's let him respond to this specific on Dodd-Frank and what the governor just said. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.",left,2012
"Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, and, you know, I appreciate, and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation, but in the past, Governor Romney has said he just wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, roll it back.",left,2012

"ROMNEY:— have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties. Except they didn't ever go on to define what a qualified mortgage was.",left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:It's been two years. We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet.,left,2012
ROMNEY:— because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. It's not that Dodd- Frank always was wrong with too much regulation.,left,2012

"Now let's move to health care, where I know there is a clear difference — (laughter) — and that has to do with the Affordable Care Act, ""Obamacare."" And it's a two-minute new segment, and it's — that means two minutes each. And you go first, Governor Romney. You wanted repeal.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:I sure do. Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, four years ago when I was running for office I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasn't just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees; it wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs.",left,2012
"LEHRER:Two minutes -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:— before -- MR. LEHRER:Two minutes is up, sir.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:No, I — I think I've — I had five seconds before you interrupted me — was — (laughter) — that the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model. And as a consequence, people are covered there.",left,2012
LEHRER:Your five -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:— leaving millions of people out in the cold. MR.,left,2012
"LEHRER:Your five seconds went away a long time ago. (Laughter.) PRESIDENT OBAMA:That -- MR. LEHRER:All right, Governor.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, I did with my first statement. PRESIDENT OBAMA:You did.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:You did. MR.,left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:But I'll go on. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Please elaborate.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:Please elaborate.,left,2012
ROMNEY:I'll elaborate. Exactly right.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan idea.,left,2012
"And Governor Romney, at the beginning of this debate, wrote and said, what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation. And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan.",left,2012
"It — when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example — unelected board that we've created — what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall, because the — there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the trend line.",left,2012
Governor Romney says we should replace it.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Let — well, actually — actually it's — it's — it's a lengthy description, but number one, pre-existing conditions are covered under my plan.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:No, it isn't.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:In my opinion, the government is not effective in — in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the costs than the government will ever be.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:They do.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Let me just point out, first of all, this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given. That's explicitly prohibited in the law.",left,2012
"That's explicitly prohibited in the law. But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan he would be able to cover people with pre-existing conditions. Well, actually, Governor, that isn't what your plan does.",left,2012
There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasn't a government takeover of health care.,left,2012
"Now, that also means that you've got more customers. But when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced, and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts is because there isn't a better way of dealing with the pre-existing conditions problem, it — it just reminds me of — you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. That's how it's going to be paid for.",left,2012
"And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?",left,2012
"LEHRER:All right, we're going to move to a -- MR. ROMNEY:No, I — I have to respond to that -- MR. LEHRER:No, but -- MR.",left,2012
"LEHRER:No, but -- MR. ROMNEY:— which is — which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and — and lay down a piece of legislation and say it's my way or the highway, I don't get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, I definitely think there are differences.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe. That's its most basic function.,left,2012
"And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that. In fact, we've seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, first, I love great schools.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:(Inaudible) -- MR.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:(Inaudible) -- MR. ROMNEY:We know that the path we're taking is not working. It's time for a new path.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, the primary responsibility for education is — is of course at the state and local level. But the federal government also can play a very important role.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, as I've indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play.",left,2012
"MR. LEHRER:Do you think you have a difference with your views and those of Governor Romney on — about education and the federal government? PRESIDENT OBAMA:You know, this is where budgets matter because budgets reflect choices.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:You know, this is where budgets matter because budgets reflect choices.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:You know, this is where budgets matter because budgets reflect choices. So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it, we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference. You know, his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about.",left,2012
"You know, his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about.",left,2012
"When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now. And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training programs -- MR. LEHRER:Do you agree, Governor?",left,2012
"LEHRER:Do you agree, Governor? PRESIDENT OBAMA:Let — let — let me just finish the point. MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:I suspect it'll be a small agreement.,left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:It's going over well in my state, by the way, yeah. PRESIDENT OBAMA:The — where their partnering so that — they're designing training programs, and people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they complete them.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:The — where their partnering so that — they're designing training programs, and people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they complete them. That makes a big difference.",left,2012
"And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference. Governor Romney, I genuinely believe, cares about education. But when he tells a student that, you know, you should borrow money from your parents to go to college, you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver just don't have that option.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Jim, Jim -- MR. LEHRER:I'm certainly going give you a chance to respond to that.",left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:Mr. — Mr.,left,2012
"LEHRER:All right, gentlemen, look -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:Jim, I — (inaudible) -- MR. LEHRER:Excuse me, one sec — excuse, me sir.",left,2012
"(Laughter.) We've got — we've got — barely have three minutes left. I'm not going to grade the two of you and say you've — your answers have been too long or I've done a poor job -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:You've done a great job, Jim. MR.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Jim, I had the great experience — it didn't seem like it at the time — of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat, and that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done. We drove our schools to be number one in the nation.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:We — as president, I will sit down on day one — actually the day after I get elected, I'll sit down with leaders — the Democratic leaders as well as Republican leaders and — as we did in my state. We met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the — in the — in our state, in that case.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal ""Obamacare,"" which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them. (Laughter.) But look, my philosophy has been I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity into the middle class.",left,2012
"And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things. And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.

So for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says these are imaginary jobs, when you've got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado who are working, creating wind power, with good- paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator in that — in Iowa is all for it, providing tax credits to help this work and Governor Romney says, I'm opposed, I'd get rid of it, that's not an energy strategy for the future. And we need to win that future, and I intend to win it as president of the United States.",left,2012

"Q: Governor Romney, you have stated that if you're elected president, you would plan to reduce the tax rates for all the tax brackets and that you would work with the Congress to eliminate some deductions in order to make up for the loss in revenue. Concerning the — these various deductions — the mortgage deduction, the charitable deductions, the child tax credit and also the — oh, what's that other credit?",left,2012
"(Laughter.) PRESIDENT OBAMA:You're doing great. Q: Oh, I remember.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Thank you very much. And — and let me tell you, you — you're absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down, I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:My philosophy on taxes has been simple, and that is, I want to give middle-class families, and folks who are striving to get in the middle class, some relief, because they have been hit hard over the last decade, over the last 15, over the last 20 years.",left,2012
"The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent. But what I've also said is for above 250,000 (dollars), we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was president, we created 23 million new jobs.",left,2012
"Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy. He was on ""60 Minutes"" just two weeks ago, and he was asked, is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 a year?",left,2012
"So we just have a different theory. And when Governor Romney stands here after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary, he stood onstage and said, I'm going to give tax cuts — he didn't say tax rate cuts; he said tax cuts — to everybody, including the top 1 percent, you should believe him, because that's been his history. And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's thriving for everybody.",left,2012
"CROWLEY:Governor Romney, I'm sure you've got a reply there. (Laughter.) MR.",left,2012
ROMNEY:(Chuckles.) You're absolutely right. You heard what I said about my tax plan.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:No, it's not settled. (Chuckles.) Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board 20 percent, along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates changes in the tax code — it costs about $5 trillion.",left,2012
"(Chuckles.) Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board 20 percent, along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates changes in the tax code — it costs about $5 trillion. Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs, even though the military's not asking for them. That's $7 trillion.",left,2012
"We haven't heard from the governor any specifics, beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood, in terms of how he pays for that. Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor. If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here; I want to spend 7 (trillion dollars) or $8 trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't have taken such a sketchy deal.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, of course they add up.",left,2012
"I've done it my entire life. So for instance, when he says, yours is a $5 trillion cut, well, no, it's not, because I'm offsetting some of the reductions with holding down some of the deductions and — and this -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:Candy -- MS. CROWLEY:Governor, I got to — I got to -- MR.",left,2012
ROMNEY:I'm — and I've told you — yeah.,left,2012

PRESIDENT OBAMA:Great.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, Katherine, this is a great question.",left,2012
"It also means that we've got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education. Earlier Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people.

"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it, he said, I'll get back to you.",left,2012
(Inaudible) — a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making. I think that's a mistake.,left,2012
"Governor Romney not only opposed it; he suggested that, in fact, employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage. That's not the kind of advocacy that women need.",left,2012
"That's not the kind of advocacy that women need. When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood for not just contraceptive care. They rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.",left,2012
"President -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:And I've got two daughters, and I want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anybody's sons have.",left,2012
"Q: Governor Romney, I am an undecided voter because I'm disappointed with the lack of progress I've seen in the last four years. However, I do attribute much of America's economic and international problems to the failings and missteps of the Bush administration.",left,2012
ROMNEY:Great.,left,2012
"I — I just want to make sure that — I think I was supposed to get that last answer, but I want to point out that I don't believe -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:I don't think so, Candy. MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:I don't believe -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, I want to make sure our timekeepers are working here. MS.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:All right. MS.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:I — I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not, and I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not.",left,2012
"And — and the — and the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Governor, that's not true. MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Let me come back and — and — and answer your question. The — President Bush and I are different people, and these are different times.",left,2012
President Obama was right. He said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, first of all, I think it's important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times.",left,2012
"And the plans that I talked about will create even more. But when Governor Romney says that he has very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts. That's what took us from surplus to deficit.",left,2012
"When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China and is currently investing in countries — in — in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks.",left,2012
"We've brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration, and we've won every single one that's been decided. When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist, that it wouldn't be helpful to American workers. Well, in fact we saved a thousand jobs, and that's the kind of tough trade actions that are required.",left,2012
"You know, there are some things where Governor Romney's different from George Bush.",left,2012
"So there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they're not on economic policy. In some ways, he's gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy, and I think that's a mistake.",left,2012
"Most things I need for everyday living are very expensive. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, we've gone through a tough four years; there's no doubt about it. But four years ago I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle-class families, and I did.",left,2012
"But you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney's made some commitments as well, and I suspect he'll keep those, too.",left,2012
"President, let me let -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:And the choice in this election is going to be whose promises are going to be more likely to help you in your life, make sure your kids can go to college, make sure that you are getting a good-paying job, making sure that Medicare and Social Security will be there for you. MS.",left,2012
ROMNEY:I think you know better. I — I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the president just described and that you don't feel like you're confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.,left,2012
"I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get.",left,2012

"MR. ROMNEY:Thank you, Lorraine. Did I get that right?",left,2012
That's a question I think the — the president will have a chance to answer right now. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Good. I look forward to it.,left,2012
"And what I've also said is, for young people who come here, brought here oftentimes by their parents, have gone to school here, pledged allegiances to the flag, think of this as their country, understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers, then we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship, and that's what I've done administratively. Now, Governor Romney just said that, you know, he wants to help those young people, too. But during the Republican primary, he said, I will veto the DREAM Act that would allow these young people to have access.",left,2012
"So we can fix this system in a comprehensive way. And when Governor Romney says the challenge is, well, Obama didn't try, that's not true. I sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term, and I said, let's fix this system, including senators previously who have supported it on the Republican side.",left,2012

He delivered his ""the era of big government is over"" speech, whichThe Washington Postsummed up this way: ""Clinton Embraced GOP Themes in Setting Agenda.""

And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now, we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.",left,2012
"Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations that we'll be better off. I've got a different view.",left,2012
"LEHRER:Governor Romney, two minutes. MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Thank you, Jim.",left,2012
"He's — as he said yours is. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, we've got to improve our education system.",left,2012
"And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people. When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high. So I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent.",left,2012
"On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we've got to boost American energy production.",left,2012
"And this is where there's a difference because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts, so that's another $2 trillion, and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for.",left,2012
"But first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that you'd like to ask the president directly about something he just said? MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, sure.",left,2012
"President. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, I think — let's talk about taxes because I think it's instructive. Now, four years ago when I stood on this stage I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families.",left,2012
"Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper income individuals can — are currently taking advantage of — if you take those all away — you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.,left,2012
"And that's why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the deficit — or — or — or not adding to the deficit, is by burdening middle-class families. The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.",left,2012
ROMNEY:Well -- MR.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:But I — but I — right, right. MR.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Yeah. Well, but — but -- MR.",left,2012
ROMNEY:— virtually every — virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate. MR.,left,2012
"LEHRER:All right, go -- MR. ROMNEY:So — so if — if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not. I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut.",left,2012
"That's part one. So there's no economist can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds 5 trillion (dollars) if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan. Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals.",left,2012
ROMNEY:This is about getting jobs for the American people.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, for 18 months he's been running on this tax plan.",left,2012
"Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth.",left,2012
"Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they're the job creators.",left,2012
"They'd be burdened. But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Jim, let me just come back on that — on that point. MR.",left,2012
ROMNEY:These small businesses we're talking about -- MR. LEHRER:Excuse me.,left,2012
ROMNEY:Yeah.,left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:It's fun, isn't it? MR.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:That's OK. MR.,left,2012
ROMNEY:You bet.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Jim, I — you may want to move on to another topic, but I would just say this to the American people. If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for — $7 trillion, just to give you a sense, over 10 years that's more than our entire defense budget — and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney's plan may work for you.",left,2012

But I think math, common sense and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth.",left,2012
The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003. And we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word, so I'm going to take it. All right?",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Well, but — but he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word of that segment, I hope.",left,2012
Let me just make this comment. PRESIDENT OBAMA:(Chuckles.) He can — you can have it. He can -- MR.,left,2012
ROMNEY:First of all -- MR. LEHRER:That's not how it works.,left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:Let me — let me repeat — let me repeat what I said — (inaudible). I'm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:OK.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Number two, let's look at history.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:It's just — it's — we've got — we got — when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today.",left,2012
"And the question — you each have two minutes on this — and, Governor Romney you go first because the president went first on segment one. And the question is this: What are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Well, good. I'm glad you raised that.",left,2012
I use that term with all respect. PRESIDENT OBAMA:I like it. MR.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Good. OK, good.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:When I walked in the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion dollar deficit greeting me, and we know where it came from. Two wars that were paid for on a credit card.",left,2012
"And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for a dollar of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. And Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that's how the commission — bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it — in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts.",left,2012
"Well, that's how the commission — bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it — in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have. Let — let me just finish this point because you're looking for contrast.",left,2012
"You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination, and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue, and he said no. Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education.",left,2012
"Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that — Governor Romney talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities -- MR. LEHRER:Mr.",left,2012
"President, I'm sorry -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:And that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:Sorry.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that. MR.",left,2012
ROMNEY:I have my own plan. It's not the same as Simpson- Bowles.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it; and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan, (a balanced ?) -- MR.",left,2012
ROMNEY:But you've been — but you've been president four years.,left,2012
ROMNEY:OK.,left,2012
"President. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, we've had this discussion before. MR.",left,2012
"LEHRER:No, about the idea that in order to reduce the deficit there has to be revenue in addition to cuts. PRESIDENT OBAMA:There has to be revenue in addition to cuts. Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:There has to be revenue in addition to cuts. Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue. He's — he's ruled out revenue.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Absolutely. PRESIDENT OBAMA:OK, so -- MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Absolutely. PRESIDENT OBAMA:OK, so -- MR. LEHRER:Completely?",left,2012
"ROMNEY:I — look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes. That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget.",left,2012
"President, you're saying in order to get it — the job done, it's got to be balanced. You've got to have -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:If we're serious, we've got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes.",left,2012
"Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get. Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money when they're making money every time you go to the pump?",left,2012
"When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue-neutral way, close loopholes, deductions — he hasn't identified which ones they are — but thereby bring down the corporate rate.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Jim, let's — we — we've gone on a lot of topics there, and — so I've got to take — it's going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools to -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:(Inaudible.) MR. LEHRER:Come back to Medicaid, here, yeah, yeah, right.",left,2012
ROMNEY:— oil to tax breaks and companies overseas.,left,2012
Now -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:It's time to end it.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:And — and in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.",left,2012
ROMNEY:But the — the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case. MR.,left,2012
ROMNEY:What we do have right now is a setting -- MR. LEHRER:Excuse me.,left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:— where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country. And finally, Medicaid to states, I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year plus inflation — inflation — plus 1 percent.",left,2012
ROMNEY:But — but the right — the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance -- MR.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:— of our people and states, not the federal government. MR.",left,2012
"President, do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security? PRESIDENT OBAMA:You know, I suspect that on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position. Social Security is structurally sound.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:— of our deficits right now.,left,2012
"LEHRER:We'll follow up on this. First, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements. MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs. And I know any time we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to change their life for the worst, and the answer is, neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare.",left,2012
"President. PRESIDENT OBAMA:First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future. And the essence of the plan is that he would turn Medicare into a voucher program.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:I don't.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Again, that's for future people -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:I understand. MR.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:— right, not for current retirees. PRESIDENT OBAMA:For — for — so if you're — if you — you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen, because this — this will affect you.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:For — for — so if you're — if you — you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen, because this — this will affect you.",left,2012
"Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it. But there's still a problem, because what happens is those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors.",left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare and the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program. MR.,left,2012
ROMNEY:So that's — that's number one.,left,2012
ROMNEY:Number two is for people coming along that are young.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Jim, if I — if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative cost than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it. And private insurers have to make a profit.",left,2012
"And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that, and if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is is that the money has to come from somewhere.",left,2012
LEHRER:We'll talk about that in a minute. PRESIDENT OBAMA:— but — but overall. MR.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:And so -- MR.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:And so -- MR. ROMNEY:That's — that's a big topic. Could we — could we stay on Medicare?,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:Is that a — is that a separate topic? I'm sorry.,left,2012
ROMNEY:Let's get back to Medicare. MR.,left,2012
"LEHRER:No, no, no, no -- MR. ROMNEY:The president said that the government can provide the service at lower -- MR. LEHRER:No.",left,2012
ROMNEY:— cost and without a profit.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.",left,2012
ROMNEY:My experience is the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.,left,2012
"LEHRER:Can we — can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice, a clear choice between the two of you -- MR. ROMNEY:Absolutely. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Yes.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:Yes. MR.,left,2012
ROMNEY:Absolutely.,left,2012
ROMNEY:Regulation is essential. You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:In some places, yes, in other places, no.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:It can become out of date. And what's happened in — with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive and it's hurt the — it's hurt the economy.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, I would repeal it and replace it.",left,2012
ROMNEY:Let me mention the other one. Let's talk the -- MR.,left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:OK. MR.,left,2012
"LEHRER:Let's let him respond to this specific on Dodd-Frank and what the governor just said. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.",left,2012
"Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, and, you know, I appreciate, and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation, but in the past, Governor Romney has said he just wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, roll it back. And so the question is does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?",left,2012
"Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:(Inaudible) — sorry, Jim.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:Yeah.,left,2012
ROMNEY:That — that's why I'd have regulation. But I wouldn't designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:— have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties.",left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:It's been two years. We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet.,left,2012
ROMNEY:— because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. It's not that Dodd- Frank always was wrong with too much regulation.,left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our — of our marketplace and our businesses, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs. MR.",left,2012
"And you go first, Governor Romney.",left,2012
ROMNEY:I sure do.,left,2012
"President, the argument against repeal. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, four years ago when I was running for office I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasn't just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees; it wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs.",left,2012
"Now, the last point I'd make before -- MR. LEHRER:Two minutes -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:— before -- MR. LEHRER:Two minutes is up, sir.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:No, I — I think I've — I had five seconds before you interrupted me — was — (laughter) — that the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model. And as a consequence, people are covered there.",left,2012
"And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down cost, as opposed to just -- MR. LEHRER:Your five -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:— leaving millions of people out in the cold. MR.",left,2012
"LEHRER:Your five seconds went away a long time ago. (Laughter.) PRESIDENT OBAMA:That -- MR. LEHRER:All right, Governor.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, I did with my first statement. PRESIDENT OBAMA:You did.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, I did with my first statement. PRESIDENT OBAMA:You did. MR.",left,2012
ROMNEY:But I'll go on.,left,2012
ROMNEY:But I'll go on. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Please elaborate. MR.,left,2012
ROMNEY:I'll elaborate.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis.,left,2012
"In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney, at the beginning of this debate, wrote and said, what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation. And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan.",left,2012
"And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan. It — when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example — unelected board that we've created — what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall, because the — there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the trend line.",left,2012
Governor Romney says we should replace it.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Let — well, actually — actually it's — it's — it's a lengthy description, but number one, pre-existing conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan.",left,2012
"But let's come back to something the president — I agree on, which is the — the key task we have in health care is to get the costs down so it's more affordable for families, and — and then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have. PRESIDENT OBAMA:No, it isn't. MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:In my opinion, the government is not effective in — in bringing down the cost of almost anything.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:They do. MR.,left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others. But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Let me just point out, first of all, this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given. That's explicitly prohibited in the law.",left,2012
"But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan he would be able to cover people with pre-existing conditions. Well, actually, Governor, that isn't what your plan does.",left,2012
There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasn't a government takeover of health care.,left,2012
"But when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced, and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts is because there isn't a better way of dealing with the pre-existing conditions problem, it — it just reminds me of — you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan.",left,2012
"And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good? Is — is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?",left,2012
"ROMNEY:No, I — I have to respond to that -- MR.",left,2012
"LEHRER:No, but -- MR. ROMNEY:— which is — which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and — and lay down a piece of legislation and say it's my way or the highway, I don't get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago.",left,2012
"President — do you believe there's a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government? PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, I definitely think there are differences. MR.",left,2012
LEHRER:And — yeah. PRESIDENT OBAMA:The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe. That's its most basic function.,left,2012
"In fact, we've seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, first, I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:(Inaudible) -- MR.,left,2012
ROMNEY:We know that the path we're taking is not working. It's time for a new path.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, the primary responsibility for education is — is of course at the state and local level.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, as I've indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play. Through our Race to the Top program, we've worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they're having an impact right now.",left,2012
"MR. LEHRER:Do you think you have a difference with your views and those of Governor Romney on — about education and the federal government? PRESIDENT OBAMA:You know, this is where budgets matter because budgets reflect choices.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:You know, this is where budgets matter because budgets reflect choices. So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it, we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:You know, this is where budgets matter because budgets reflect choices. So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it, we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference. You know, his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about.",left,2012
"You know, his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about.",left,2012
"And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training programs -- MR. LEHRER:Do you agree, Governor?",left,2012
"LEHRER:Do you agree, Governor? PRESIDENT OBAMA:Let — let — let me just finish the point. MR.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:I suspect it'll be a small agreement.,left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:It's going over well in my state, by the way, yeah. PRESIDENT OBAMA:The — where their partnering so that — they're designing training programs, and people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they complete them.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:The — where their partnering so that — they're designing training programs, and people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they complete them.",left,2012

"ROMNEY:Jim, Jim -- MR. LEHRER:I'm certainly going give you a chance to respond to that.",left,2012
ROMNEY:Mr.,left,2012
"LEHRER:All right, gentlemen, look -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:Jim, I — (inaudible) -- MR.",left,2012
"(Laughter.) We've got — we've got — barely have three minutes left. I'm not going to grade the two of you and say you've — your answers have been too long or I've done a poor job -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:You've done a great job, Jim. MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Jim, I had the great experience — it didn't seem like it at the time — of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat, and that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:We — as president, I will sit down on day one — actually the day after I get elected, I'll sit down with leaders — the Democratic leaders as well as Republican leaders and — as we did in my state.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal ""Obamacare,"" which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them. (Laughter.) But look, my philosophy has been I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity into the middle class.",left,2012

PRESIDENT OBAMA:Right.,left,2012
"Do you have any regrets about that? PRESIDENT OBAMA:No, I don't because I think that America has to stand with democracy. The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F.",left,2012
"SCHIEFFER:Governor Romney, I want to hear your response to that, but I would just ask you, would you have stuck with Mubarak?",left,2012
"ROMNEY:No, I believe, as the president indicated and said at the time, that I supported his — his action there. I felt that — I wish we'd have had a better vision of the future.",left,2012

"ROMNEY:Well, I — I absolutely believe that America has a — a responsibility and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that — that make the world more peaceful.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:America remains the one indispensable nation.,left,2012
"And, Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger — in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat. But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America.",left,2012
"And we've got to make sure that we reduce our deficit. Unfortunately, Governor Romney's plan doesn't do it. We've got to do it in a responsible way, by cutting out spending we don't need but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more.",left,2012
Now Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign.,left,2012
"SCHIEFFER:Governor Romney, wrong and reckless policies?",left,2012

"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, let's talk about what we need to compete.

"ROMNEY:That was actually mine, actually, Mr.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Well, let's — let's come back and talk about the military, but all the way — all the way through. First of all, I'm going through, from the very beginning, we're going to cut about 5 percent of the discretionary budget excluding military.",left,2012

"ROMNEY:Let's go back to the military, though. MR.",left,2012
ROMNEY:Let's talk about the military.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:You should have answered the first question.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:You should have answered the first question. Look, Governor Romney's called for $5 trillion of tax cuts that he says he's going to pay for by closing deductions. Now, the math doesn't work but he continues to claim that he's going to do it.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Bob, I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets.",left,2012
ROMNEY:I — I'm going to be able to balance the budget.,left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:Our Navy is older — excuse me — our Navy is smaller now than any time since 1917. The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Bob, I just need to comment on this. First of all, the sequester is not something that I proposed.",left,2012
"It's maintaining it. But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works. You — you mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916.",left,2012
"SCHIEFFER:All right. PRESIDENT OBAMA:And you know, we've visited the website quite a bit. And it still doesn't work.",left,2012
"Would either of you — and you'll have two minutes, and President Obama, you have the first go at this one.",left,2012
"President. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, first of all, Israel is a true friend. It is our greatest ally in the region.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:I will stand with Israel if they are attacked. And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history.",left,2012
"The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that during the course of this campaign he's often talked as if we should take premature military action. I think that would be a mistake because when I've sent young men and women into harm's way, I always understand that that is the last rest, not the first resort.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, first of all, I — I want to underscore the — the same point the president made, which is that if I'm president of the United States, when I'm president of the United States, we will stand with Israel. And — and if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, first of all, those were reports in the newspaper. They are not true.",left,2012
"It's very straightforward. And you know, I'm glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we're taking. You know, there have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you'd do the some things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that that would make a difference, and it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking; it's meticulous.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:And we're going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don't have a nuclear weapon. MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration and — and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be. I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Bob, let me just respond. Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing.",left,2012
"Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing. This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign, and every fact-checker and every reporter who's looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true.",left,2012
ROMNEY:We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran. We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.,left,2012
"We have freed other nations from dictators. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Bob, let me — let me respond. You know, if we're going to talk about trips that we've taken, you know, when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Bob, let's not go into hypotheticals of that nature. Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the prime minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way or their fighters are on the way.",left,2012
SCHIEFFER:So you're saying just what -- MR. ROMNEY:I'm — that's — that's -- MR. SCHIEFFER:OK.,left,2012
"But let's see what — (inaudible) -- MR. ROMNEY:Yes, but let me — let me — let me come back — let's come back — let's come back and go back to what the president was speaking about, which is what's happening in the world and — and — and the president's statement that things are going so well. Look, I — I look at what's happening around the world and I see Iran four years closer to a bomb.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:No. MR.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:They asked him, please repair the tension — Democrat senators — please repair the damage in his — in his own party.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map. I mean, I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:And — and I make that point because that's the kind of clarity of leadership — and those decisions are not always popular. Those decisions generally are not poll-tested.,left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Bob -- MR. SCHIEFFER:Governor, you get to go first.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:You can't — you can't — well, OK, but you can't have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, that's probably true. (Chuckles.) MR.",left,2012
(Chuckles.) MR. SCHIEFFER:And we'll — we'll give you -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:We'll agree (with that ?). MR.,left,2012
"Do we still leave? And I believe Governor Romney, it — you go first. MR.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Well, we're going to be finished by 2014. And when I'm president, we'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014.",left,2012
"President. PRESIDENT OBAMA:You know, when I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq, and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade. We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan.",left,2012
Let me go to Governor Romney because you talked about Pakistan and what needs to be done there.,left,2012
We know that Pakistan has arrested the doctor who helped us catch Obama's — bin Laden.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:No, it's not time to divorce a nation on earth that has a hundred nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation — as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani network. It's a nation that's not like — like others and that does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there.",left,2012
"MR. SCHIEFFER:Let me ask you, Governor, because we know President Obama's position on this, what is — what is your position on the use of drones? MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, I believe that we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world. And it's widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that entirely and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology and believe that we should continue to use it to continue to go after the people who represent a threat to this nation and to our friends.",left,2012
"We have not seen the progress we need to have, and I'm convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden. We've created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism — in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks.",left,2012
"I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case, said this wouldn't be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist.",left,2012
"And unfortunately, Governor Romney's budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments. MR.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Well, first of all, it's not government that makes business successful. It's not government investments that make businesses grow and hire people.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, Governor Romney's right.",left,2012
"You know, if we had taken your advice, Governor Romney, about our auto industry, we'd be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China. If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that are in profits overseas don't pay U.S.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:I just want to take one of those points. Again, attacking me is not talking about an agenda for getting more trade and opening up more jobs in this country.",left,2012
"I said they need — these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy, and in that process they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd — they'd built up. And fortunately the president picked -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:Governor Romney, that's not what you said. MR.",left,2012

MR. ROMNEY:And — and that's I have the kind of commitment to make sure that our industries in this country can compete and be successful. We in this country can compete successfully with anyone in the world.,left,2012

"Governor Romney, as you know, you won the coin toss, so the first question will go to you. And I want to turn to a first- time voter, Jeremy Epstein, who has a question for you.",left,2012
"President, Governor Romney, as a 20-year-old college student, all I hear from professors, neighbors and others is that when I graduate, I will have little chance to get employment. Can — what can you say to reassure me, but more importantly my parents, that I will be able to sufficiently support myself after I graduate?",left,2012
"Can — what can you say to reassure me, but more importantly my parents, that I will be able to sufficiently support myself after I graduate? MITT ROMNEY:Thank you, Jeremy. I appreciate your — your question, and — and thank you for being here this evening.",left,2012
Q: (Off mic.) MR. ROMNEY:2014. When you come out in 2014 — I presume I'm going to be president — I'm going to make sure you get a job.,left,2012
"President. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright, and the fact that you're making investment in higher education is critical, not just to you but to the entire nation. Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country, but not just jobs, good-paying jobs, ones that can support a family.",left,2012
"You know, when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt, I said, we're going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry, and it's come surging back.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, what you're seeing in this country is 23 million people struggling to find a job, and a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long, long time.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Candy, what Governor Romney said just isn't true.",left,2012
"And that — don't take my word for it; take the executives at GM and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans, may even support Governor Romney. But they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work.",left,2012
And Governor Romney says he's got a five-point plan.,left,2012
Governor Romney doesn't have a five-point plan; he has a one-point plan.,left,2012
"And Mr. Romney — Governor Romney, there'll be plenty of chances to go on, but I want to — we have all these folks -- MR. ROMNEY:That — that Detroit — that Detroit answer — that Detroit answer and the rest of the answer — way off the mark.",left,2012
ROMNEY:That — that Detroit — that Detroit answer — that Detroit answer and the rest of the answer — way off the mark. MS.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy.,left,2012
"Now, Governor Romney will say he's got an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies. So he's got the oil and gas part, but he doesn't have the clean energy part.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Well, let's look at the president's policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we've had four years of policies being played out. And the president's right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Candy, there's no doubt that world demand's gone up.",left,2012
And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true.,left,2012
"And when I hear Governor Romney say he's a big coal guy — and keep in mind when — Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, this plant kills, and took great pride in shutting it down. And now suddenly you're a big champion of coal.",left,2012
ROMNEY:But that's not what you done in the last four years.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:Sure it is.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:In the last four years, you cut permits and licenses on federal land and federal waters in half.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:In the last four years, you cut permits and licenses on federal land and federal waters in half. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Not true, Governor Romney. MR.",left,2012
ROMNEY:So how much did you cut them by? PRESIDENT OBAMA:It's not true.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:It's not true.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:By how much did you cut them by, then? PRESIDENT OBAMA:Governor, we have actually produced more oil on -- MR.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Governor, we have actually produced more oil on -- MR. ROMNEY:No, no, how much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters?",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Governor, we have actually produced more oil on -- MR. ROMNEY:No, no, how much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters? PRESIDENT OBAMA:Governor Romney, here's what we did.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:No, no, how much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters? PRESIDENT OBAMA:Governor Romney, here's what we did. There were a whole bunch of oil companies -- MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:No, I had a — I had a — I had a question -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:No, you — no, you — you — you want -- MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:No, I had a — I had a — I had a question -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:No, you — no, you — you — you want -- MR. ROMNEY:— and the question was how much did you cut them by? PRESIDENT OBAMA:— you want me to answer a question, I'm -- MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:— and the question was how much did you cut them by? PRESIDENT OBAMA:— you want me to answer a question, I'm -- MR. ROMNEY:How much did you cut them by?",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:— you want me to answer a question, I'm -- MR. ROMNEY:How much did you cut them by? PRESIDENT OBAMA:— I'm happy to answer the question.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:— I'm happy to answer the question. MR.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:All right, and it is? PRESIDENT OBAMA:Here's what happened.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:Here's what happened. You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren't using.,left,2012
ROMNEY:OK — (inaudible) -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:And so what we did was take away -- MR.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:OK — (inaudible) -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:And so what we did was take away -- MR. ROMNEY:That's -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:— those leases, and we are now reletting them so that we can actually make a profit. MR.",left,2012
ROMNEY:And — and — and production on private — on government lands is down.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:And the production is up.,left,2012
ROMNEY:Production on government land of oil is down 14 percent.,left,2012
ROMNEY:Production on government land of oil is down 14 percent. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Governor -- MR. ROMNEY:And production of gas is down 9 percent.,left,2012
ROMNEY:And production of gas is down 9 percent.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:What you're saying is just not true.,left,2012
ROMNEY:I — it's absolutely true.,left,2012
"Look, there's no question but that the people recognize that we have not produced more oil -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:I'll give you your time. Go ahead.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:— and gas on federal lands and in federal waters. And coal — coal production is not up, coal jobs are not up.",left,2012
"I'm still speaking. (Chuckles.) PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, Governor, if — if you're asking me a question, I'm going to answer it. MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:My — and the answer is I don't believe people think that's the case, because I — I'm — that wasn't a question. PRESIDENT OBAMA:OK.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:OK. All right.,left,2012
ROMNEY:That was a statement.,left,2012
ROMNEY:Those things will get us the energy we need.,left,2012
"Is that true? PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, think about what the governor — think about what the governor just said. He said when I took office, the price of gasoline was 1.80 (dollars), 1.86 (dollars).",left,2012
Because the economy was on the verge of collapse; because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney is now promoting.,left,2012
"Because the economy was on the verge of collapse; because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney is now promoting. So it's conceivable that Governor Romney could bring down gas prices, because with his policies we might be back in that same mess. (Audience murmurs.) What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong and at the same time produce energy.",left,2012
"(Audience murmurs.) What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong and at the same time produce energy. And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about, we've — we've built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire Earth once. So I'm all for pipelines; I'm all for oil production.",left,2012
"So for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says these are imaginary jobs, when you've got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado who are working, creating wind power, with good- paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator in that — in Iowa is all for it, providing tax credits to help this work and Governor Romney says, I'm opposed, I'd get rid of it, that's not an energy strategy for the future.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:No, he — he gets the first — he actually got — he actually got the first question.",left,2012
ROMNEY:Actually -- MS.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Candy, Candy, Candy, I don't have a policy of — of stopping wind jobs in Iowa and that — they're not phantom jobs.",left,2012
ROMNEY:I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and across our country. I appreciate the jobs in coal and oil and gas.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:— that taking advantage of our energy resources will bring back manufacturing to America. We're going to get through a very aggressive energy policy, 3.5 million more jobs in this country.",left,2012
"It's critical to our future. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Candy, it's OK. MS.",left,2012
"MS. CROWLEY:We're going to move you along to taxes -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:I'm used — I'm used to being interrupted. You know, the -- MS.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Hi, Mary. Q: Governor Romney, you have stated that if you're elected president, you would plan to reduce the tax rates for all the tax brackets and that you would work with the Congress to eliminate some deductions in order to make up for the loss in revenue.",left,2012
"Q: Governor Romney, you have stated that if you're elected president, you would plan to reduce the tax rates for all the tax brackets and that you would work with the Congress to eliminate some deductions in order to make up for the loss in revenue.",left,2012
(Laughter.) PRESIDENT OBAMA:You're doing great.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Thank you very much. And — and let me tell you, you — you're absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down, I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:My philosophy on taxes has been simple, and that is, I want to give middle-class families, and folks who are striving to get in the middle class, some relief, because they have been hit hard over the last decade, over the last 15, over the last 20 years.",left,2012
The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.,left,2012
"Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy. He was on ""60 Minutes"" just two weeks ago, and he was asked, is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 a year?",left,2012
"So we just have a different theory. And when Governor Romney stands here after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary, he stood onstage and said, I'm going to give tax cuts — he didn't say tax rate cuts; he said tax cuts — to everybody, including the top 1 percent, you should believe him, because that's been his history. And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's thriving for everybody.",left,2012
"CROWLEY:Governor Romney, I'm sure you've got a reply there.",left,2012
ROMNEY:(Chuckles.) You're absolutely right.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:No, it's not settled.",left,2012
"Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs, even though the military's not asking for them.",left,2012
"We haven't heard from the governor any specifics, beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood, in terms of how he pays for that. Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor. If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here; I want to spend 7 (trillion dollars) or $8 trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't have taken such a sketchy deal.",left,2012
"And Governor, let's — before we get into a vast array of who said what — what study says what, if it shouldn't add up, if somehow when you get in there, there isn't enough tax revenue coming in, if somehow the numbers don't add up, would you be willing to look again at a 20 percent -- MR. ROMNEY:Well, of course they add up. I was — I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years and balanced the budget.",left,2012
"I've done it my entire life. So for instance, when he says, yours is a $5 trillion cut, well, no, it's not, because I'm offsetting some of the reductions with holding down some of the deductions and — and this -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:Candy -- MS. CROWLEY:Governor, I got to — I got to -- MR.",left,2012
"CROWLEY:Governor, I got to — I got to -- MR. ROMNEY:I'm — and I've told you — yeah. MS.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:And I just — and I just described to you, Mr. President -- MS.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:I just described to you precisely how I do it, which is with a single number that people can put — and they can put their deductions and credits — (inaudible) -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:(Inaudible.) MS. CROWLEY:Mr.",left,2012
"President, you're — we're keeping track, I promise you. PRESIDENT OBAMA:OK. MS.",left,2012
"President, the next question is for you, so stay standing. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Great. Looking forward to it.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, Katherine, this is a great question.",left,2012
Earlier Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people.,left,2012
"MS. CROWLEY:Governor Romney, pay equity for women. MR.",left,2012
ROMNEY:Thank you.,left,2012
ROMNEY:I'm going to help women in America get — get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce. MR.,left,2012
"President, why don't you get in on this quickly, please? PRESIDENT OBAMA:Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it, he said, I'll get back to you. And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.",left,2012
(Inaudible) — a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making. I think that's a mistake.,left,2012
"Governor Romney not only opposed it; he suggested that, in fact, employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.",left,2012
"When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood for not just contraceptive care. They rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.",left,2012
"President -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:And I've got two daughters, and I want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anybody's sons have.",left,2012
"Q: Governor Romney, I am an undecided voter because I'm disappointed with the lack of progress I've seen in the last four years. However, I do attribute much of America's economic and international problems to the failings and missteps of the Bush administration.",left,2012
ROMNEY:Great. Thank you.,left,2012
"I — I just want to make sure that — I think I was supposed to get that last answer, but I want to point out that I don't believe -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:I don't think so, Candy. MR.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:I don't believe -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, I want to make sure our timekeepers are working here. MS.",left,2012
The timekeepers are all working. PRESIDENT OBAMA:All right. MS.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:I — I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not, and I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not.",left,2012
"And — and the — and the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Governor, that's not true. MR.",left,2012
ROMNEY:Let me come back and — and — and answer your question.,left,2012
President Bush didn't. President Obama was right. He said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, first of all, I think it's important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I started.",left,2012
"And the plans that I talked about will create even more. But when Governor Romney says that he has very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts. That's what took us from surplus to deficit.",left,2012
"That's what took us from surplus to deficit. When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China and is currently investing in countries — in — in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks. That's — Governor, you're the last person who's going to get tough on China.",left,2012
"When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist, that it wouldn't be helpful to American workers.",left,2012
"You know, there are some things where Governor Romney's different from George Bush. George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a voucher.",left,2012
"So there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they're not on economic policy.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, we've gone through a tough four years; there's no doubt about it.",left,2012
"But you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney's made some commitments as well, and I suspect he'll keep those, too.",left,2012
"President, let me let -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:And the choice in this election is going to be whose promises are going to be more likely to help you in your life, make sure your kids can go to college, make sure that you are getting a good-paying job, making sure that Medicare and Social Security will be there for you.",left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:I think you know better. I — I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the president just described and that you don't feel like you're confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.,left,2012
"I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get. You're going to get a repeat of the last four years.",left,2012
"President, I'll be right back with you. And Lorraine Osario has a question for you about a topic we have not heard -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:This is for Governor Romney? MS.",left,2012
"CROWLEY:Yes, this is for Governor Romney, and we'll be right with you, Mr.",left,2012
ROMNEY:Is it Lorraina (ph)? Q: Lorraine.,left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Lorraine? Q: Yeah, Lorraine, yeah.",left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:(Great ?). Q: How you doing?,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Good, thanks.",left,2012
"Q: President — Romney, what do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green cards that are currently living here as productive members of society? MR.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Thank you, Lorraine. Did I get that right?",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:Good.,left,2012
"And what I've also said is, for young people who come here, brought here oftentimes by their parents, have gone to school here, pledged allegiances to the flag, think of this as their country, understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers, then we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship, and that's what I've done administratively. Now, Governor Romney just said that, you know, he wants to help those young people, too. But during the Republican primary, he said, I will veto the DREAM Act that would allow these young people to have access.",left,2012
"And when Governor Romney says the challenge is, well, Obama didn't try, that's not true.",left,2012
ROMNEY:Let's -- MS.,left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Let — no, let — let me go back and speak to the points that the president made and — and let's get them correct. I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect.",left,2012
"Let me -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:Candy, hold on a second.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:I — I — you know, I'm still — Mr. President, I'm still speaking.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Governor Romney, I — I'm — I'm — I'm — (inaudible) — make sure — (inaudible) -- MR.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Governor Romney, I — I'm — I'm — I'm — (inaudible) — make sure — (inaudible) -- MR. ROMNEY:Mr. President, why don't you let me finish?",left,2012
"The president made a -- MS. CROWLEY:Go ahead and finish, Governor Romney. Governor Romney, if you could make it short.",left,2012
"Governor Romney, if you could make it short.",left,2012
ROMNEY:Yeah. Just going to make a point.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:(Inaudible) — Candy -- MR. ROMNEY:Have you looked at your pension?,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:(Inaudible) — Candy -- MR. ROMNEY:Have you looked at your pension? PRESIDENT OBAMA:I've got to say — (inaudible) -- MR.,left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:I've got to say — (inaudible) -- MR. ROMNEY:Mr.,left,2012
ROMNEY:Mr.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:You know, I don't look at my pension. It's not as big as yours, so it — it doesn't take as long.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:Well, let me — let me give you — (laughter) — let me — let me give you some advice. PRESIDENT OBAMA:I don't check it that often.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:I don't check it that often. (Chuckles.) MR.,left,2012
(Chuckles.) MR. ROMNEY:Let me give you some advice. Look at your pension.,left,2012
Look at your pension. PRESIDENT OBAMA:(Chuckles.) OK. MR.,left,2012
ROMNEY:You also investments in Chinese companies. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Yeah.,left,2012
ROMNEY:You also investments in Chinese companies. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Yeah. MR.,left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:You also have investments outside the United States. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Yeah.,left,2012
ROMNEY:You also have investments outside the United States. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Yeah. MR.,left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:You also have investments through a Caymans trust, all right? PRESIDENT OBAMA:All right.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:All right.,left,2012
"CROWLEY:And we are way — we're sort of way off topic here, Governor Romney.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:So — so Mr. President — so -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:We're — we're — we're a little off topic here, yeah.",left,2012
"President — so -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:We're — we're — we're a little off topic here, yeah. Come on.",left,2012
ROMNEY:I came — I came back to what you spoke about before.,left,2012
"President — if I could have you sit down, Governor Romney.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:I do want to make sure that we just understand something. Governor Romney says he wasn't referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:I do want to make sure that we just understand something. Governor Romney says he wasn't referring to Arizona as a model for the nation. His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it — not E-Verify, the whole thing.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:I'll get it done. I'll get it done, first year.",left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:We have not seen Republicans -- MS. CROWLEY:OK, Mr.",left,2012
"President let me move you on here, please. PRESIDENT OBAMA:— serious about this issue at all. MS.",left,2012
President -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:And it's time for them to get serious on it.,left,2012
"Don't go away, because -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:I'm — I'm here. MS.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:OK.,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:I'm sorry, what's your name?",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:Great to see you here. Q: This question actually comes from a brain trust of my friends at Global Telecom Supply in Mineola yesterday.,left,2012
"Who was it that denied enhanced security and why? PRESIDENT OBAMA:Well, let me, first of all, talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation. And these aren't just representatives of the United States; they're my representatives.",left,2012
"And number three, we are going to find out who did this, and we are going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I've said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them. Now, Governor Romney had a very different response. While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release trying to make political points.",left,2012
"While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release trying to make political points.",left,2012
"MR. ROMNEY:Thank you, Kerry, for your question. It's an important one.",left,2012
Does the buck stop with your secretary of state as far as what went on here? PRESIDENT OBAMA:Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job. But she works for me.,left,2012
"ROMNEY:Yeah, I — I certainly do.",left,2012
It was not a spontaneous demonstration. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Please proceed. MR.,left,2012
ROMNEY:Is that what you're saying?,left,2012
"PRESIDENT OBAMA:Please proceed, Governor.",left,2012
"ROMNEY:I — I — I want to make sure we get that for the record, because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror. PRESIDENT OBAMA:Get the transcript.",left,2012
PRESIDENT OBAMA:Get the transcript. MS.,left,2012
"So let me — let me call it an act of terrorism — (inaudible) -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:Can you say that a little louder, Candy?",left,2012
ROMNEY:This — the administration — the administration — (applause) — indicated that this was a — a reaction to a — to a video and was a spontaneous reaction. MS.,left,2012
MR. ROMNEY:It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group and — and to suggest — am I incorrect in that regard? On Sunday the — your — your secretary or -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:Candy -- MR.,left,2012
On Sunday the — your — your secretary or -- PRESIDENT OBAMA:Candy -- MR.,left,2012
ROMNEY:Excuse me.,left,2012

By Steve Mullis Afterseveral days of stumbleson the trail — andinternal squabblingspilling into public view — Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's campaign vowed to get back to substance on Monday.,left,2012
"The spotlight, however, was stolen by areporton the website ofMother Jones. The story shows clips of Romney at what the magazine says is a fundraiser earlier this year, talking very candidly to wealthy donors about what he thinks of voters who support President Obama. NPR has not yet independently verified the authenticity of the videos.",left,2012
"In one of the clips being talked about the most, Romney says: There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.",left,2012
"I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives."" NPR's Ari Shapiro toldAll Things Consideredthat Romney appears to write off nearly half the American population, the ""47 percent that don't pay income tax,"" as dependents who believe they are victims, a message Romney doesn't want to send when he's trying to fight a stereotype of being an elitist.",left,2012

Putting a point on it, he said, ""I will not change any provisions of Massachusetts' pro-choice laws."" Eight years earlier, in 1994, when Romney unsuccessfully challenged the late Sen.
