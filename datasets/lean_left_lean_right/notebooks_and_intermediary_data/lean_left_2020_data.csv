"(Proud Boys is now using Trump's words aspart of a new logo.) What's more, Trump would not urge his followers to remain peaceful as votes are counted, including if there aredelays in reporting the results.

"Trump has accentuated that this year by signaling to Republicans that he's against mail-in ballots and that they're corrupt, and by signaling to Republicans as well that theCOVID pandemicis not as serious as the scientists say it is.

"They're going to be able to decide for themselves how they operate that day, and maybe they'll be sued after the fact, but it will be too late to make much difference in terms of the outcome.

"— ""all able-bodied men and women to stop the election from being stolen by Democrats."" On some of the other ways Trump might contest results I think there's reasonable concern that when the president and his son are using the rhetoric they're using about the need to secure an election against people trying to steal it, when the president has supporters who are prepared to carry weapons and to appoint themselves into militia-like roles, there's a significant concern that there will be violence or physical disorder at the polls on election night and afterward during the canvass.
