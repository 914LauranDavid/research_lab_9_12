            "Relevant fragments: [\"blueapples on XOne of the most confounding responses to the belief that the 2020 Presidential Election was rigged to keep Donald Trump from being re-elected has been the Republicans' belief that voting in 2024 will somehow get him back into office. In the build up to this year's presidential election,there have been ample signs that the integrity of America's elections is still compromised.The cognitive dissonance of the right wing of the US electorate has led them to overlook clear indications that 2024 could be nothing more than a replay of 2020.\", 'There has\\xa0beenno greater sign of the continued attempts to corrupt the electoral process than with what happened during an ABC broadcast of a Formula 1 race on Sunday. During the Mexico Grand Prix,viewers watching on the Pennsylvania local ABC affiliate WNEP-TV saw the station reporting the results of the presidential election in the state, with Kamala Harris winning by 5% over Donald Trump.The margin of victory for Harris of nearly 300,000 votes eclipses the amount Biden \"won\" the state by in 2020 by nearly 4 times as much. The ABC affiliate responded to claims that their broadcast signified a predetermined outcome by stating that the graphic had been randomly generated as part of a test of the systems in place for their forthcoming coverage on election night.', 'In total, 2,186,450 mail-in ballots were requested in the state for this year\\'s election.In 2020, mail-in ballots from the Democratic stronghold of Philadelphia alone took nearly 4 days to count.The lack of initiative taken to change the state\\'s election laws means that the outcome of the race in Pennsylvania may not be known until days after election night yet again.Despite the response by WNEP-TV to assuage the public of concerns that the \"mistake\" was not indicative of anything more than a technical error,the gaffe by the station raises more questions about if votes in swing states will be manipulated in favor of the Democratic establishment.If Trump does go on to lose the 2024 election, this moment is sure to rear its ugly head as evidence in support of claims that the election was rigged against him yet again.']\n",

If Trump loses the election, it will mean the total & permanent closure of the American political system. Kamala Harris was practically grown in a lab to demonstrate the limits of manufacturing consent — the ultimate act of political creationex nihilo.', 'The only issue that has generated any enthusiasm for Kamala Harris is abortion: an issue that Donald Trump can’t even pretend to care about, and never made any gestures toward, even in the primaries. So not only is she fake — the opponent her base is voting against is also a total media confabulation.', 'I think they threw everything they had at Trump in 2020.']\n",

For the Democratic Party to shed itself of the failures of the Biden administration,it would require a stark deviation away from the radical platform it has built itself upon since 2020.In doing so, the democrats could effectively run themselves as the uniparty by fostering a political climate more conducive to moderate voters much like how Bill Clinton successfully did in forming the New Democrat ideology that won him consecutive elections in 1992 and 1996 at a time the Democratic Party was in shambles every bit as much as it is today.

Trump inflated his way out of this situation in July 2019, and since then, the inflationary environment has only worsened due to reckless government spending under Biden and his Keynesian agenda.', 'The US economy remained in an inflationary mode from then until October 2013 under Obama, who delivereda deflationary economy to Trump in early 2017.

Savvy investors understand that the use of fiat currencies in an inflationary environment can create amonetary illusion.', 'As shown before, regardless of who is the next tenant of the White House, investors should now understand that the liquidity cycle, whichhistorically lasts for 65 months,will peak in late 2025. The peak of the liquidity tsunami will coincide with a wave of debt refinancing as both candidates, Trump and Harris, agree on one key issue:increasing US government debt.

Vance as Vice President.', 'Such outcomes would inevitably lead toan ungovernable situation, exacerbating divisions between red and blue states and accelerating the disunion of the U.S., which seems already increasingly inevitable. When he isn’t joking about frying French fries at McDonald’s or driving a garbage truck, Donald Trump occasionally referencesWilliam McKinley, the 25th U.S. president, known for hiscommitment to protectionist policies.', 'Based on previous decisions made by the US Supreme Court (i.e., SCOTUS),martial law is not established by any official authority outside of the sitting president.Rather,martial law arises from necessity. In this context, investors, voters, and every citizen must understand that, while highly controversial,Joe Biden could justify a declaration of necessityif Russia, China, North Korea, or Iran were to declare war or attack before the election, or in the ‘lame duck period’ until January 20th. Consequently, the Democrats, under the influence of neocons who are unelected and disregard the constitution, could carry outa coup,suspend the election, and seize control of the country, similar to what Zelensky did in Ukraine under the same rationale.', 'After that, Joe Biden would only need toresign as president on January 20thor before, likely arguing that he is not physically or mentally fit to be a \"War President.\" This wouldmake Kamala Harris the ‘de facto president’of the US, fulfilling the requirement to transfer power before January 21st of the year following the 4-year election cycle. While US laws require a lengthy process involving the President, House, and Senate, often needing bipartisan support, presidents can also govern via executive orders, which carry the force of law but only bind the executive branch.', 'For example, Trump’s border-wall order was challenged in court for overstepping spending authority, and Biden later rescinded it. Without a court ruling,only a president can reverse an executive order, though Congress can pass legislation to override it.', 'Without a court ruling,only a president can reverse an executive order, though Congress can pass legislation to override it.

A quick look at the evolution of the USD under the last 4 US presidents shows that, despite imposing tariffs for the first time since the world became globalized, the last Trump presidency saw a decline of around 9.0% in the USD index.

In this context, investors, voters, and every citizen must understand that, while highly controversial,Joe Biden could justify a declaration of necessityif Russia, China, North Korea, or Iran were to declare war or attack before the election, or in the ‘lame duck period’ until January 20th. Consequently, the Democrats, under the influence of neocons who are unelected and disregard the constitution, could carry outa coup,suspend the election, and seize control of the country, similar to what Zelensky did in Ukraine under the same rationale.', 'They would need to close all courts, including the Supreme Court, out of necessity, whether real or manufactured.
