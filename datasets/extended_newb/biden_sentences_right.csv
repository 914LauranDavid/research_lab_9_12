President Biden served 36 years as a senator from Delaware, the most corporate-friendly state in the nation.,"right"
As one observer noted, Biden was a neoliberal who became an economic nationalist because he apparently came to the conclusion that markets were broken, that power was too concentrated and workers were disempowered.,"right"
But now the torch has been passed, so will Vice President Harris follow President Biden’s lead?,"right"
The Biden-Harris administration’s frustration has been palpable.,"right"
Yet polling seems to suggest that Harris is not being blamed or credited (yet) for the Biden economic record.,"right"
To pay for this, Harris has adopted some and tweaked other parts of President Biden’s latest budget, which calls for new taxes on the wealthy and corporations but would keep the pledge that no one making under $400,000 a year would see a tax increase.,"right"
WASHINGTON — A key question is looming for Vice President Kamala Harris as she edges closer to gaining the Democratic presidential nomination: Can she turn the Biden-Harris economic record into a political advantage in a way that President Joe Biden failed to do?,"right"
In some ways, her task would seem straightforward: The administration oversaw a vigorous rebound from the pandemic recession, one that shrank the U.S. unemployment rate to a half-century low of 3.4% in early 2023 — far below the painful 6.4% rate when Biden and Harris took office in 2021.,"right"
JD Vance of Ohio, has attacked Biden over the surge in housing costs, which has diminished the hopes of many would-be homebuyers.,"right"
Speaking this week in Indianapolis, Harris highlighted her support for “affordable health care” and “affordable child care.” She also charged that Trump would eliminate the Biden administration's price cap on insulin, which the White House often cites as an example of its efforts to reduce high drug costs.,"right"
Grocery prices are up 21% since Biden and Harris took office.,"right"
A pound of ground beef has jumped $1.05 since Biden’s inauguration, to a national average of $5.36 a pound, according to government data.,"right"
Economists at the Biden administration have calculated, though, that average wages have risen enough to make up for the higher costs.,"right"
Economists at Motio Research have calculated that since Biden was inaugurated in January 2021, inflation-adjusted median household incomes have risen just 1.6% to $79,000.,"right"
Government overspending, an activity the Biden administration has taken to a new level, has sent the country into an inflationary spiral.,"right"
Rather than reversing course, President Joe Biden is telling voters the private sector is to blame and that he has the answers.,"right"
But that hasn't stopped Biden from blaming energy companies — the same companies that reduced prices to record lows in relatively freer markets during the Trump administration.,"right"
Don't forget about renters, who, like homebuyers, are no better off now than they were before Biden's activist regulatory spree took hold.,"right"
Once again, however, the Biden administration found a convenient and private-sector scapegoat.,"right"
President Joe Biden's letter announcing that he is standing down from the general election documented all the reasons the incumbent had to go.,"right"
Biden should have announced he was not running for reelection a year ago — or, at the very least, before he blew the June 27 debate with Donald Trump.,"right"
Now that he has announced he is not running for reelection, Biden nonetheless apparently plans to stay in office.,"right"
Biden's actions have shown the world that he himself is every bad thing he has said about his 78-year-old Republican rival — unwilling to let go of power, uninterested in putting the country first and not even remotely up to the job.,"right"
Biden, who had tested positive for COVID in Las Vegas, seemed unaware of recent polls that showed Trump ahead, often beyond the margin of error.,"right"
That was the big moment in Joe Biden's demise.”,"right"
In his letter, Biden gave a nod to Kamala Harris, 59.,"right"
When Biden chose the then-California U.S. senator, he made no secret of the fact that the former San Franciscan's race and gender were prime reasons behind his choice.,"right"
There's no way Biden can abandon her now.,"right"
In 2020, party leaders and primary voters decided that Biden was the only Democrat who could beat Trump.,"right"
And then Biden became the guest who wouldn't leave.,"right"
Having invalidated the votes of more than 14 million Americans who selected Joe Biden to be the Democrat nominee for president, the self-proclaimed 'party of democracy' has proven exactly the opposite.”,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is meeting Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the White House on Thursday as the three nations use their first-ever trilateral summit to try to show they are in lockstep about countering China's military assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific.,"right"
The U.S. Coast Guard will also welcome Filipino and Japanese coast guard members onto a U.S. Coast Guard vessel during the patrol for training, according to senior Biden administration officials who insisted on anonymity to preview the talks.,"right"
The summit comes a day after Biden held one-on-one talks with Kishida and feted the Japanese premier with a glitzy state dinner at the White House, a diplomatic honor meant to recognize Tokyo's growing clout on the global stage.,"right"
Biden also was hosting Marcos for a private meeting at the White House ahead of the scheduled three-way talks.,"right"
Biden on Wednesday reflected on the fact that Japan, once a fierce U.S. enemy, has become one of the closest American partners and an indispensable ally in a shared push for peace, security and prosperity in the Pacific and beyond.,"right"
“Just a few generations ago, our two nations were locked in a devastating conflict,” Biden said with Kishida by his side for a pomp-filled arrival ceremony at the White House.,"right"
Biden, in a wide-ranging phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, raised concerns about China’s operations in the South China Sea, including efforts to impede the Philippines, which the U.S. is treaty-obligated to defend, from resupplying its forces on the Second Thomas Shoal.,"right"
Biden has made improving relations with the Philippines a priority since Marcos became the country's president in June 2022.,"right"
Biden hosted him for talks at the White House last year, the first Washington visit by a Philippine president in more than a decade.,"right"
Biden also met him on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly soon after Marcos took office, and dispatched Vice President Kamala Harris to Manila in 2022 to meet him.,"right"
President Joe Biden, late last month, received a booster shot of the COVID-19 vaccine.,"right"
One Instagram post showed Biden receiving the shot with the caption, "Fake president, in a fake White House, receiving fake booster.","right"
It was where five days earlier Biden participated in a global coronavirus summit.,"right"
Other social media posts claimed it was a "body double," not Biden, who received the vaccine booster, asking, "Can you explain where the tattoo is?","right"
The post showed Biden receiving the shot in his left arm, free from any tattoos, and an image of the shirtless person, purportedly Biden with a prominent tattoo on his left arm, washing a car outside the White House.,"right"
One of these images is fake, according to Reuters, but it's not the photo of Biden getting the shot.,"right"
It was used with a fake story that said Biden was washing his 1981 Trans Am and included the fake quote, "Gotta get her looking good so I can impress the chicks when I'm cruising down Pennsylvania (Avenue).","right"
WASHINGTON — Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning.,"right"
The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs.,"right"
— To a defiant President Joe Biden, the 2024 election is up to the public — not the Democrats on Capitol Hill.,"right"
On Saturday, a fifth Democratic lawmaker said openly that Biden should not run again.,"right"
Angie Craig of Minnesota said that after what she saw and heard in the debate with Republican rival Donald Trump, and Biden’s “lack of a forceful response” afterward, he should step aside “and allow for a new generation of leaders to step forward.”,"right"
Craig posted one of the Democrats’ key suburban wins in the 2018 midterms and could be a barometer for districts that were vital for Biden in 2020.,"right"
But it is bound to drag on until Biden steps aside or Democrats realize he won’t and learn to contain their concerns about the president’s chances against Trump.,"right"
Pelosi and Clyburn had both raised pointed questions about Biden in the aftermath of the debate.,"right"
“Biden is who our country needs,” Clyburn said late Friday after Biden's interview with ABC aired.,"right"
On Saturday, Biden’s campaign said the president joined a biweekly meeting with all 10 of the campaign’s nation co-chairs to “discuss their shared commitment to winning the 2024 race.” Clyburn was among them.,"right"
More House Democrats are likely to call for Biden to step aside when lawmakers return to Washington at the start of the week.,"right"
Biden had public schedule Saturday, as he and aides stepped back from the fervor over the past few days.,"right"
Ten days into the crisis moment of the Biden-Trump debate, Biden is dug in.,"right"
They were particularly concerned that Biden suggested that even if he were to be defeated in a rematch with Trump, he would know that he gave it his all.,"right"
As Biden’s camp encourages House lawmakers to give the president the chance to show what he can do, one Democratic aide said the Friday interview didn't help and in fact made things worse.,"right"
The aide expects more Democrats will likely be calling on Biden to step aside.,"right"
Democratic leaders in the House and Senate, without breaking with Biden at this point, are pulling together meetings with members in the next few days to discuss options.,"right"
Biden roundly swatted away calls Friday to step away from the race, telling telling voters at a Wisconsin rally, reporters outside Air Force One and ABC's George Stephanopoulos that he was not going anywhere.,"right"
Biden dismissed those who were calling for his ouster, instead saying he'd spoken with 20 lawmakers and they had all encouraged him to stay in the race.,"right"
Concern about Biden’s fitness for another four years has been persistent.,"right"
In an August 2023 poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, fully 77% of U.S. adults said Biden was too old to be effective for four more years.,"right"
Biden has dismissed the polling, citing as evidence his 2020 surge to the nomination and win over Trump, after initially faltering, and the 2022 midterm elections, when polls suggested Republicans would sweep but didn’t, largely in part over the issue of abortion rights.,"right"
At times, Biden rambled during the interview, which ABC said aired in full and without edits.,"right"
Asked how he might turn the race around, Biden argued that one key would be large and energetic rallies like the one he held Friday in Wisconsin.,"right"
“Trump is a pathological liar,” Biden said, accusing Trump of bungling the federal response to the COVID pandemic and failing to create jobs.,"right"
Republicans, though, are squarely behind their candidate, and support for Trump, who at 78 is three years younger than Biden, has been growing.,"right"
A single apostrophe — or lack thereof — caused an uproar in the presidential race Tuesday night after President Joe Biden criticized former President Donald Trump during a virtual event and later denied he was referring to Trump’s supporters as “garbage.”,"right"
Biden was speaking on an evening call to rally Latino voters when he brought up a Trump rally speaker’s racist insult of Puerto Rico over the weekend.,"right"
“Just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a ‘floating island of garbage,’” Biden said, referring to comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s comment at Trump’s rally Sunday in New York.,"right"
His — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American,” Biden said, according to an audio recording from a Washington Post reporter who listened in on the call.,"right"
The White House initially provided a transcript of Biden’s remarks that purported to show him saying “supporters’” — a plural possessive.,"right"
Will Kamala apologize and disavow Joe Biden’s remarks?”,"right"
By 9:31 p.m., Biden himself sought to clear up the situation.,"right"
“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it,” Biden said on X.,"right"
As for Biden, the president has a record of verbal gaffes that have long loomed over his life in public service — and which partly fueled the Democratic anxieties that precipitated his decision to end his reelection campaign this summer.,"right"
Biden’s remarks came shortly before Harris was set to deliver her closing argument in a major speech Tuesday night in Washington.,"right"
Biden was speaking during an early-voting call organized by Voto Latino, a Latino advocacy group that has endorsed Harris.,"right"
Asked for comment, a Trump campaign spokesperson pointed to a social media post from top campaign adviser Chris LaCivita, who cited Biden’s comment and said: “Remember … [Harris] hates you and they hate the American spirit vote accordingly.”,"right"
It is not the first time Biden has gone off-script while seeking to boost Harris after ending his own campaign.,"right"
Vance responded to Biden’s comment on Tuesday night.,"right"
“Kamala Harris and her boss Joe Biden are attacking half of the country.,"right"
Democrats were not fully united in defending Biden late Tuesday night.,"right"
Asked about Biden’s comments on CNN, Josh Shapiro — the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, a critical swing state for Harris — did not dispute that Biden had disparaged Trump supporters.,"right"
President Biden arrives Friday in Madison, Wis., for what will be a critical few hours as he holds a rally attempting to inject new life into a flagging campaign and sits for an ABC News interview as part of an effort to demonstrate his verbal and mental ability.,"right"
In the seven days that have passed since the June 27 presidential debate between Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, the Biden campaign has faced an onslaught of concerns and complaints, with calls from fellow Democrats for him to drop out, donors angry that he is not doing more to reassure voters, and advisers trying to rally behind him.,"right"
Biden and his team, recognizing that they face a narrow window to steady the situation and prevent further defections within an already anxious Democratic Party, scrambled to stage an afternoon rally in a key swing state and agreed to an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that will air in prime time Friday.,"right"
Overall, Friday will amount to one of the most critical days of Biden’s long political career.,"right"
It is Biden’s fifth trip to the state this year, and the rally in Madison will include Rep.,"right"
Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), who is running her own reelection race and leads in the polls, will not be joining Biden during the trip.,"right"
Ben Wikler, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, who will join Biden at the rally, said he did not believe the dynamic of the race was changed by Biden’s performance at the debate, when he was often groping for words.,"right"
Biden is scheduled to arrive in Wisconsin early Friday afternoon, with plans to be in the state for a few hours.,"right"
Biden’s campaign said it is using the event in Wisconsin to jump-start a month of heightened activity, including a $50 million advertising campaign that will target major moments like the Olympics Games, which begin July 26, as well as counterprogramming that will take place during the Republican National Convention, which is July 15-18.,"right"
On Sunday, Biden is scheduled to speak in Philadelphia before the National Education Association.,"right"
Next week he will host a NATO summit in Washington, which will bring more than 30 heads of state to the nation’s capital and include a solo news conference by Biden.,"right"
For the past week, Biden’s family has been trying to bolster him and has been supportive of his staying in the race, according to four people familiar with their thinking who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.,"right"
While it has raised eyebrows from some within the West Wing - Hunter Biden last month was convicted of three felony gun charges - people close to the president’s son say he is beginning to reclaim a role he has long played in his father’s political career.,"right"
Hunter Biden has been optimistic about his father’s ability to recover from the missteps of the debate and has aggressively rebuffed anyone who doubts him, according to people close to Hunter.,"right"
Members of Biden’s family recognize the rocky debate performance, and the tenuous moment, but believe that absent high-level defections or a significant drop in polling data, he will remain the Democratic nominee.,"right"
They also note that critics have doubted Biden throughout his political career only for him to defy expectations, and they fully expect him to do so again, the people said.,"right"
— President Joe Biden on Friday formally apologized to Native Americans for the “sin” of a government-run boarding school system that for decades forcibly separated children from their parents, calling it a “blot on American history” in his first presidential visit to Indian Country.,"right"
“It's a sin on our soul,” said Biden, his voice full of anger and emotion.,"right"
Biden spoke of the abuses and deaths of Native children that resulted from the federal government's policies, noting that “while darkness can hide much, it erases nothing” and that great nations “must know the good, the bad, the truth of who we are.”,"right"
“I formally apologize as president of United States of America for what we did,” Biden said.,"right"
Democrats hope Biden's visit to the Gila River Indian Community’s land on the outskirts of Phoenix's metro area will also provide a boost to Vice President Kamala Harris' turnout effort in a key battleground state.,"right"
The moment gave Biden a fuller chance to spotlight his and Harris’ support for tribal nations, a group that historically has favored Democrats, in a state he won just by 10,000 votes in 2020.,"right"
Biden has been used sparingly on the campaign trail by Harris and other Democrats since he ended his reelection campaign in July.,"right"
But analysts say Biden could help Harris in her appeal with Native American voters — a group that has trailed others in turnout rates.,"right"
In 2020, there was a surge in voter turnout on some tribal land in Arizona as Biden beat Trump and became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1996.,"right"
Biden, whose presidency is winding down, had promised tribal leaders nearly two years ago that he would visit Indian Country.,"right"
“President Biden deserves credit for finally putting attention on the issue and other issues impacting the community,” said Ramona Charette Klein, 77, a boarding school survivor and an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa.,"right"
The White House says Biden and Harris have built a substantial track record with Native Americans over the last four years.,"right"
Biden picked former New Mexico Rep.,"right"
She, in turn, ordered the comprehensive review in June 2021 of the troubled legacy of the federal government's boarding school policies that led Biden to deliver the formal apology.,"right"
Sean Casten and Jesus “Chuy” Garcia on Friday added their voices to the growing chorus of Democrats calling for President Joe Biden to end his reelection campaign over fears of losing not only the Oval Office but also both chambers of Congress.,"right"
In a telephone interview Friday, Downers Grove’s Casten praised Biden’s political accomplishments and said he still has “every confidence” that Biden can carry on the duties of president.,"right"
But Casten said he no longer believes Biden can make the campaign a referendum about what he would do in four more years in the White House versus what Trump would do in four years.,"right"
Casten also expressed concern that Biden remaining in the race would drag down Democrats seeking down-ballot posts, including those running for U.S. House and Senate seats.,"right"
Jared Huffman of California, Marc Veasey of Texas and Marc Pocan of Wisconsin released a joint statement respectfully calling for Biden to step aside for a new generation of like-minded leaders.,"right"
Three other members of Illinois’ Democratic delegation to Congress — Brad Schneider of Highland Park, Mike Quigley of Chicago and Eric Sorensen of Moline — earlier called for Biden to drop out of the race, following a widely panned debate performance in late June that drew attention to the 80-year-old Biden’s age and mental acuity.,"right"
At 78, Trump isn’t much younger than Biden.,"right"
Not all Democrats think Biden should withdraw.,"right"
Jan Schakowsky of Evanston on Friday said she is “100% behind the Biden-Harris team.”,"right"
Bill Foster of Naperville hasn’t publicly moved away from supporting Biden’s campaign.,"right"
Raja Krishnamoorthi of Schaumburg said the congressman has met with Biden about how to mount a winning campaign against Trump and will give Biden space to make a decision.,"right"
Casten said he will fully support whoever Democrats nominate at their national convention in Chicago, even if that candidate is Biden.,"right"
The campaigns of President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have agreed to two debates in 2024 — the first on June 27, the second on Sept.,"right"
As Fahrenkopf told Politico, Biden adviser Anita Dunn and Biden whisperer Ron Klain have long opposed the bipartisan commission, which was formed in 1987.,"right"
Then, on Wednesday, Biden released a video in which he challenged Trump to two debates.,"right"
“Well, make my day, pal,” Biden mugged.,"right"
“So let's pick the dates, Donald,” Biden continued.,"right"
Trump bit — after Team Biden had set terms, including an automatic microphone turnoff when a speaker's time has expired.,"right"
Biden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon argued in a letter to the commission that the first debate should occur after Trump's criminal trial is expected to be over and Biden's return from the G7 summit.,"right"
I just re-watched the two 2020 Trump-Biden debates, just to see what America might be missing.,"right"
Without a teleprompter and onstage for some two hours for each debate, Biden sounded sharper and more authoritative than he does from an East Room podium these days.,"right"
If you watch the 2020 exchanges, you feel the profound difference between age 81, Biden's age now, and a 77-year-old (Biden's age then and Trump's age now).,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Wednesday delivered a solemn call to voters to defend the country's democracy as he laid out in an Oval Office address his decision to drop his bid for reelection and throw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris.,"right"
Insisting that “the defense of democracy is more important than any title,” Biden used his first public address since his announcement Sunday that he was stepping aside to deliver an implicit repudiation of former President Donald Trump.,"right"
The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.,"right"
“Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,” Biden said, in a somber coda to his 50 years spent in public office.,"right"
“I revere this office,” Biden said.,"right"
Trump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden.,"right"
6, 2021, which Biden called “the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.”,"right"
Biden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor’s attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats.,"right"
Biden, who said he believed his record was deserving of another term in office, tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to end his campaign only mounted from the party’s political elites and from ordinary voters.,"right"
“I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,” Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for “fresh voices, yes, younger voices.”,"right"
Biden’s address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks.,"right"
The president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.,"right"
“The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,” Biden said.,"right"
Biden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad.,"right"
But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris’ electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.,"right"
His advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as “tough” and “capable,” albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.,"right"
Biden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he’ll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump.,"right"
Biden said he’s grateful to have served as president — nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.,"right"
Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office before the election — which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent — was “ridiculous.”,"right"
Jean-Pierre said Biden has “no regrets” about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend.,"right"
She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.,"right"
Trump, who watched Biden's remarks from his private jet, posted on his social media platform that the president “was barely understandable, and sooo bad!”,"right"
As he spoke inside the Oval Office, Biden was joined off-camera by family members, including his wife, Jill, son Hunter, daughter Ashley and several grandchildren.,"right"
Hundreds of administration aides held a watch party in the White House and gathered in the Rose Garden afterward to hear Biden thank them for their service.,"right"
Outside the gates, supporters of Biden gathered holding signs that read “We love Joe,” and a brass band played.,"right"
At a March 15 Democratic presidential debate, front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden announced he intended to slate a woman as his running mate.,"right"
A Biden campaign official said he "is familiar with the process of selecting a vice presidential candidate, having been on the opposite end of the process in 2008.,"right"
Those names includes Biden's former rivals California Sen.,"right"
He also was the first Illinois congressman to endorse Biden.,"right"
But only President Joe Biden will be the face of the war's chaotic, violent conclusion.,"right"
Republicans overwhelmingly criticized Biden and he found few vocal backers among fellow Democrats.,"right"
The collapse of the Afghan government is the biggest foreign policy crisis of Biden's young presidency, recalling setbacks for past presidents such as the withdrawal from Vietnam and the botched Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba.,"right"
In the face of such stark consequences, Biden admitted no fault for the chaotic drawdown and instead forcefully defended his move to leave a nation the U.S. has tried to safeguard since it toppled the Taliban regime after the Sept.,"right"
"Here's what I believe to my core: It is wrong to order American troops to step up when Afghanistan's own armed forces would not," said Biden.,"right"
When Biden took responsibility, it was more for ending the war than for the manner in which it happened.,"right"
But I would rather take that criticism than pass this on to a fifth president," said Biden.,"right"
But he announced that the U.S. would pull all its forces out by May 2021, an agreement Biden honored and delayed only slightly.,"right"
In the upper ranks of Biden's staff, the rapid collapse in Afghanistan only confirmed the decision to leave: If the meltdown of the Afghan forces would come so quickly after nearly two decades of American presence, another six months or a year or two or more would not have changed anything.,"right"
But on Monday, Republicans were eager to slam Biden's decision and blame him for the chaos, though many of them had supported a withdrawal when it had been proposed by Trump a year ago.,"right"
Biden has argued for more than a decade that Afghanistan was a kind of purgatory for the United States.,"right"
WASHINGTON — Four years ago, candidate Joe Biden stood before supporters at a Detroit high school, flanked by Kamala Harris and other rising Democratic stars, and called himself a bridge to the next generation of leaders.,"right"
Biden, now a president seeking reelection, returns to the city Friday with many in his party now pleading for him to fulfill that very promise and step aside.,"right"
But Biden remains defiant that he'll remain in the race despite a disastrous debate performance that triggered a wave of calls for him to end his candidacy.,"right"
During a news conference on Thursday, when asked why he no longer considered himself a “bridge” to the next generation of leaders, Biden responded that “what changed was the gravity of the situation I inherited in terms of the economy, foreign policy, and domestic division.”,"right"
“We've never been here before,” Biden continued.,"right"
In the two weeks since his debate debacle, Biden and his team have been on a relentless sprint to persuade fretting lawmakers, nervous donors and a skeptical electorate that at the age of 81, he is still capable of being president.,"right"
But a spate of travel to battleground states, interviews with journalists and a rare solo news conference have done little to tamp down the angst within the party about Biden's candidacy and his prospects against Donald Trump in November.,"right"
So far, one Democratic senator and 16 House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to step aside, with the latest statements — from Connecticut Rep.,"right"
Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has indicated Biden still has a decision to make on whether to run, even though the president has made it clear he remains in the race.,"right"
Meanwhile, his reelection campaign has indirectly acknowledged that Biden's route to the White House is narrowing, saying the so-called “blue wall” of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania is now the “clearest pathway” to victory even as other battleground states like Arizona and Nevada are not out of reach.,"right"
That strategy is reflected in how Biden is redoubling his efforts in the Midwestern states, hitting Detroit nearly one week after he campaigned in Madison, Wisconsin; Philadelphia; and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.,"right"
Rallying enthusiasm in Detroit and among its sizable Black population could prove decisive for Biden’s chances of winning Michigan, which Biden reclaimed in 2020 after Donald Trump won it in four years prior by just over 10,000 votes.,"right"
But at a critical juncture when Biden needs to consolidate support, key Democratic leaders in the state will notably be absent at Friday's event, where Biden plans to speak about the “Project 2025” agenda, a massive proposed overhaul of the federal government drafted by longtime allies and former officials in the Trump administration.,"right"
Gretchen Whitmer, who is co-chair of Biden’s campaign, will be out of the state.,"right"
Gary Peters, a steadfast supporter of Biden, and Rep.,"right"
United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, whom Biden actively courted during last year’s strikes and who met with him and other union leaders Wednesday, is traveling for a conference.,"right"
Hillary Scholten, who is seeking reelection in a battleground district in western Michigan, joined a growing list of national Democrats who have called on Biden to step aside for another candidate.,"right"
But in a swing state that he won by close to 3 percentage points in 2020, Biden continues to command support.,"right"
Shri Thanedar and AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler will all attend the Detroit event, which marks Biden's fourth trip to the state this year.,"right"
And over a dozen Detroit-area state lawmakers signed onto a joint letter Thursday “to express our unwavering support for President Joe Biden.”,"right"
“We encourage all our members and allies to join us in supporting President Biden and Vice President Harris.”,"right"
In his return to Michigan, Biden aims to reignite the energy felt in March 2020 when appearing at Detroit's Renaissance High School.,"right"
During that appearance, Biden had locked hands with Harris, Whitmer and New Jersey Sen.,"right"
“I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,” Biden said.,"right"
Biden reclaimed much of that support four years ago, when he defeated Trump in Michigan by a 154,000-vote margin, but he has work to do.,"right"
Key parts of Biden’s coalition in Michigan are also upset with him over Israel’s offensive following Hamas’ Oct.,"right"
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who has a history of gaffes, Thursday night told a group of mostly minority voters in Iowa that "poor kids" are just as bright as "white kids.","right"
Biden, who has been leading in national and early state polling for the Democratic presidential nomination, was speaking on the subject of education at a town hall in Des Moines hosted by the Asian and Latino Coalition.,"right"
"We should challenge students in these schools that have advanced placement programs in these schools," Biden said.,"right"
In a statement Friday, Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said Biden "misspoke and immediately corrected himself during a refrain he often uses to make the point that all children deserve a fair shot, and children born into lower-income circumstances are just as smart as those born to wealthy parents.","right"
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, another Democratic White House hopeful, also sought to draw attention to Biden's comments - as well as his campaign's response.,"right"
"To quickly dismiss @JoeBiden's words as a mere 'slip of the tongue' is as concerning as what he said," de Blasio said on Twitter.,"right"
Thursday was not the first time Biden's comments on race have prompted scrutiny.,"right"
In February 2007, on the day he launched his bid for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, Biden found himself defending comments made a week earlier in an interview with the New York Observer about then-Sen.,"right"
Biden issued a statement that day, saying: "I deeply regret any offense my remark in the New York Observer might have caused anyone.,"right"
A Monmouth University poll released Thursday showed Biden leading the Democratic field in Iowa, with 28 percent of possible 2020 Democratic caucus voters.,"right"
Adam Schiff on Wednesday became the highest-profile Democrat to call for President Joe Biden to drop his reelection bid, even as the party pushed ahead with plans for a virtual vote to formally make Biden its nominee in the first week of August.,"right"
19, follows nearly 20 Democratic members of Congress calling on Biden to withdraw from the presidential race in the wake of his dismal debate performance against Republican former President Donald Trump last month.,"right"
Among Democrats nationwide, nearly two-thirds say Biden should step aside and let his party nominate a different candidate, according to a new AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll — sharply undercutting Biden's post-debate claim that “average Democrats” are still with him even if some “big names” are turning on him.,"right"
“While the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden’s alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch,” Schiff said in a statement.,"right"
It was Pelosi who revived questions about Biden post-debate, when she said recently that “it’s up to the president” to decide what to do — even though Biden had fully stated he had no intention of stepping aside.,"right"
In response to Schiff's comments, the Biden campaign pointed to what it called “extensive support” for him and his reelection bid from members of Congress in key swing states, as well as from the Congressional Black and Hispanic caucuses.,"right"
Biden is traveling in Nevada this week, and the campaign noted that he's been joined on the trip by “nearly a dozen” Congressional Black Caucus members.,"right"
Still, Schiff's announcement came after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries encouraged the party to delay for a week plans to hold the virtual vote to renominate Biden, which could have taken place as soon as Sunday, according to two people familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.,"right"
19-22, but the party announced in May that it would hold an early roll call to ensure Biden would qualify for the ballot in Ohio.,"right"
The Biden campaign insists that the party must operate under Ohio’s initial rules to ensure Republican lawmakers can’t mount legal challenges to keep the president off the ballot.,"right"
Even if Democrats conduct a virtual roll call vote ahead of their convention, though, it wouldn’t necessarily lock Biden into the nomination.,"right"
1, Biden appearing on the state’s ballot remains a real concern, Kamarck said.,"right"
The AP-NORC poll, conducted as Biden works to salvage his candidacy two weeks after his debate flop, also found that only about 3 in 10 Democrats are extremely or very confident that he has the mental capability to serve effectively as president, down slightly from 40% in an AP-NORC poll in February.,"right"
The letter from Daughtry and Walz comes a day after a contingent of House Democrats wary of swiftly nominating Biden as the party’s pick for reelection circulated another letter raising “serious concerns” about plans for a virtual roll call.,"right"
(AP) — A federal judge in Kansas has refused to block the nationwide enforcement of a Biden administration rule requiring firearms dealers to do background checks of buyers at gun shows, leaving Texas as the only state so far where a legal challenge has succeeded.,"right"
Twenty-six states with Republican attorneys general, gun owner groups and individual gun collectors filed three federal lawsuits in May against the Biden administration.,"right"
Critics contend the new rule violates gun rights protected by the Second Amendment and that Democratic President Joe Biden's administration doesn't have the legal authority to issue it.,"right"
WASHINGTON — Hunter Biden asked the U.S. ambassador to Italy for help regarding an energy project a Ukrainian gas company was pursuing while his father was vice president, according to The New York Times.,"right"
Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden, wrote a letter to the ambassador in 2016 seeking assistance for Burisma, which had been working on a geothermal project in Italy, the newspaper reported, citing newly released records and interviews.,"right"
At the time, Hunter Biden sat on the board of Burisma, which was having trouble getting regulatory approval for the project, a businessman involved in the project told the newspaper.,"right"
The revelation is likely to fuel Republican criticism of Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings, which have been the center of GOP investigations into the president’s family.,"right"
The report comes weeks before Hunter Biden is set to stand trial on federal charges alleging he failed to pay taxes on money he received from Burisma and other foreign businesses.,"right"
Prosecutors indicated last week in court papers they want to introduce evidence at trial about Hunter Biden's other business dealings, including an arrangement with a Romanian businessman who was trying to “influence U.S. government policy” during Joe Biden’s term as vice president.,"right"
Hunter Biden's lawyer said his client's outreach to the ambassador on behalf of Burisma was a “proper request” and that he had asked “various people” to help arrange an introduction between Burisma and the president of Italy's Tuscany region.,"right"
The records suggest that embassy officials were uneasy about Hunter Biden's request, according to the newspaper.,"right"
“He’s certainly not aware of this and this is something that Hunter Biden has to speak to.,"right"
Pressed on whether Biden was satisfied with how his son conducted himself, Jean-Pierre told reporters: “I can’t speak to this.,"right"
Phillips, the U.S. ambassador to Italy at the time, said he received a lot of letters and did not remember Hunter Biden reaching out to him.,"right"
“I certainly would pay attention to it” if the younger Biden had contacted him, Phillips told the newspaper.,"right"
Hunter Biden's trial set to begin in Los Angeles in September alleges a four-year scheme to avoid paying at least $1.4 million in taxes during a time in which the president's son has acknowledged struggling with a drug addiction.,"right"
Hunter Biden's lawyers have indicated they will argue at trial that drug use affected his decision-making and judgment to the point that he was “unable to form the requisite intent to commit the crimes he has been charged with.”,"right"
To those concerned that Donald Trump might become president again, consider these examples of idiocracy from Joe Biden's rule:,"right"
Biden killed the Keystone XL pipeline and took other steps to make the U.S. A energy dependent on foreign nations.,"right"
Biden botched the Afghanistan withdrawal, leaving American citizens behind and put allies' lives at risk.,"right"
Biden stopped border wall construction and opened the border to a free flow of illegal immigrants, criminals and fentanyl.,"right"
Biden pushed for student loan givebacks in order to win votes and ignored the Supreme Court ruling that the givebacks are illegal.,"right"
Biden has drained our Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to lower gas prices and win votes.,"right"
Biden has weaponized the DOJ and the FBI to target his political opponents and put them in prison, thus tampering with the election process.,"right"
Bidenflation has eaten away at our citizen's buying power, standard of living and retirement savings.,"right"
Biden's weak foreign policy has enabled bad actors and we are now in proxy wars with Iran, Russia and (coming soon) China.,"right"
One word can be said about voting for Biden for a second term: don’t.,"right"
WASHINGTON - House Republicans issued subpoenas Wednesday to members of President Joe Biden's family, taking their most aggressive step yet in an impeachment inquiry bitterly opposed by Democrats that is testing the reach of congressional oversight powers.,"right"
But Republicans say the evidence trail they have uncovered paints a troubling picture of "influence peddling" by Biden's family in their business dealings, particularly with clients overseas.,"right"
"Now, the House Oversight Committee is going to bring in members of the Biden family and their associates to question them on this record of evidence," Comer, of Kentucky, said in a statement.,"right"
The stakes are exceedingly high, as the inquiry could result in Republicans bringing impeachment charges against Biden, the ultimate penalty for what the U.S. Constitution describes as "high crimes and misdemeanors.","right"
The subpoenas demand that Hunter Biden and James Biden as well as former business associate Rob Walker appear before the Oversight Committee for a deposition.,"right"
Lawmakers also requested that James Biden's wife, Sara Biden, and Hallie Biden, the wife of the president's deceased son Beau, appear voluntarily for transcribed interviews.,"right"
Requests for comment from Hunter Biden, who lives in California, and James Biden, who's from Royal Oak, Maryland, were not immediately returned.,"right"
Both the White House and the Biden family's personal lawyers have dismissed the investigation as a political ploy aimed at hurting the Democratic president.,"right"
Hunter Biden's attorney Abbe Lowell said the investigation has been full of "worn-out, false, baseless, or debunked claims." In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday morning, Lowell urged the new speaker to rein in the "partisan political games.","right"
Johnson, now settling into the speakership after replacing Kevin McCarthy as the top Republican in the House, has given his blessing to the inquiry and has hinted that a decision could come soon on whether to pursue articles of impeachment against Biden.,"right"
Since January, Republicans have been investigating the Biden family for what they claim is a pattern of "influence peddling" spanning back to when Biden was Barack Obama's vice president.,"right"
Comer claims the committee had "uncovered a mountain of evidence" that he said would show how Biden abused his power and repeatedly lied about a "wall" between his political position and his son's private business dealings.,"right"
While questions have arisen about the ethics surrounding the Biden family's international business, no evidence has emerged to prove that Joe Biden, in his current or previous office, abused his role or accepted bribes.,"right"
WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris has secured the support of enough Democratic delegates to become her party’s nominee against Republican Donald Trump, according to an Associated Press survey, as top Democrats rallied to her in the aftermath of President Joe Biden’s decision to drop his bid for reelection.,"right"
The quick coalescing behind Harris marked an attempt by the party to put weeks of internecine drama over Biden’s political future behind them and to unify behind the task of defeating Trump with just over 100 days until Election Day.,"right"
Prominent Democratic elected officials, party leaders and political organizations quickly lined up behind Harris in the day after Biden's exit from the race and her campaign set a new 24-hour record for presidential donations on Monday.,"right"
Harris, in a statement, responded to the AP tally, saying she is “grateful to President Biden and everyone in the Democratic Party who has already put their faith in me, and I look forward to taking our case directly to the American people.”,"right"
Worries over Biden’s fitness for office were replaced by fresh signs of unity after a seismic shift to the presidential contest that upended both major political parties’ carefully honed plans for the 2024 race.,"right"
“The name has changed at the top of the ticket, but the mission hasn’t changed at all,” Biden said in his first public remarks since announcing his decision to step aside, promising he was “not going anywhere” and plans to campaign on Harris’ behalf.,"right"
Biden said of his decision, “It was the right thing to do.”,"right"
As he handed off the mantle of leadership to Harris, Biden added: “I’m watching you kid.,"right"
Locking up the nomination was only the first item on the staggering political to-do list for Harris after learning of Biden’s plans to leave the race Sunday morning on a call with the president.,"right"
She must also pick a running mate and pivot a massive political operation that had been built to reelect Biden to boost her candidacy instead.,"right"
On Sunday afternoon, Biden’s campaign formally changed its name to Harris for President, reflecting that she is inheriting his political operation of more than 1,000 staffers and war chest that stood at nearly $96 million at the end of June.,"right"
She added $81 million to that total in the first 24 hours after Biden’s endorsement, her campaign said — a presidential fundraising record — with contributions from more than 888,000 donors.,"right"
The campaign also saw a surge of interest after Harris took over, with more than 28,000 new volunteers registered since the announcement — a rate more than 100 times an average day from the previous Biden reelection campaign, underscoring the enthusiasm behind Harris.,"right"
19-22 in Chicago, but the party had announced before Biden dropped out that it would hold a virtual roll call to formally nominate Biden before in-person proceedings begin.,"right"
During my 25-plus years as a Herald subscriber and a now transplanted and proud St. Charles resident living in Florida (awesome weather and hideous politics), I’ve read my share of howlers in the letters to the editor but Tonia Khouri’s Feb 12 “both sides” screed trashing Joe Biden for failures at the border takes the cake.,"right"
I’d like to relieve her of the delusion that Democrats and Republicans unite in opposition to Biden’s failures.,"right"
They don’t want solutions because they’d have to defend them to their voters and they’d lose the club they so willingly use to beat Biden or Obama or any other Democrat they want to label as “soft” on the border.,"right"
If you have any doubt about whether the White House press corps has a different standard for President Joe Biden than for former President Donald Trump, consider the press briefings that followed their first physicals as president at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.,"right"
Biden's physical occurred last Friday.,"right"
O'Connor offered that Biden "remains a healthy, vigorous 78-year-old male, who is fit to execute the duties of the Presidency." (The next day, Biden turned 79.),"right"
O'Connor also wrote that since the last year, Biden experienced more frequent "throat clearing," probably because of esophageal reflux and allergies, as well as "perceptibly stiffer and less fluid" ambulatory gait.,"right"
Biden's annual physical, which included a colonoscopy, was held during a packed news day that included the traditional Thanksgiving turkey pardon and House passage of the Build Back Better Act.,"right"
That meant less time for questions on Biden's physical - and most of those questions were about the logistics of the exam.,"right"
One reporter asked Psaki about a Politico/Morning Consult poll that reported 50% of voters surveyed did not agree with the statement that "President Biden is in good health," and voters are almost evenly split on the question of if he is in "good mental health." She then asked for Psaki's take.,"right"
There were no questions about the asthma for which Biden got five draft deferments.,"right"
There were no questions that referred to Biden's two brain surgeries more than two decades ago, no questions about his atrial fibrillation or what O'Connor described as "moderate to severe spondylosis." There was no question about the "mild sensory peripheral neuropathy of both feet" and whether it might have played a role in Biden fracturing bones in his foot while playing with a family dog a year ago.,"right"
Amazingly, there were no direct questions about whether Biden was given a cognitive test or if he had a psychiatric exam.,"right"
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell is endorsing Joe Biden, saying with him in the White House, 'œWe will never doubt that he will stand with our friends and stand up to our adversaries - never the other way around.'ť,"right"
In taped remarks during the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday night, Powell sought to draw an implicit contrast between Biden and President Donald Trump, without naming Trump.,"right"
He said that Biden 'œwill trust our diplomats and our intelligence community, not the flattery of dictators and despots.'ť Trump has expressed doubts about findings from the intelligence community on Russian involvement in the 2016 campaign, and has praised dictators.,"right"

JuliÃ¡n Castro, the only Latino in the historically diverse primary field, wasn't given a speaking slot at the convention after some tense moments with Biden during the campaign.,"right"
The Democratic Party has formally made Joe Biden its presidential nominee, a position he has sought for more than 30 years and through three White House bids.,"right"
Delegates from each state took a roll call vote during the second night of the virtual Democratic National Convention on Tuesday, awarding Biden the position.,"right"
Biden actually clinched the nomination in early June.,"right"
A former senator from Delaware and vice president, Biden first ran for president in 1988 and tried again in 2008 before launching his 2020 campaign last year.,"right"
Most delegates went to Joe Biden, but some went to Vermont Sen.,"right"
In Nebraska, the woman nominating Biden wore a face mask as she talked about essential workers battling the pandemic.,"right"
Speakers included Biden's onetime rivals Minnesota Sen.,"right"
Two politicians from Joe Biden's home state of Delaware and a security guard who met Biden in an elevator have formally nominated him as the Democratic presidential nominee.,"right"
Jacquelyn Brittany met Biden when he went to The New York Times for an interview last year, and a video of their interaction went viral.,"right"
Chris Coons, who holds Biden's former Senate seat, says Biden understands the struggles and hopes of everyday people.,"right"
Lisa Blunt Rochester, also of Delaware, says future schoolchildren will learn about the pain and grief of this time in America but also about how a 'œPresident Biden'ť restored decency and integrity to American democracy.,"right"
He also praised Democratic candidate Joe Biden but spent far more time on the offensive against Trump, who defeated his wife, Hillary, to clinch the presidency in 2016.,"right"
Caroline Kennedy is portraying Joe Biden as a public servant in the spirit of her father, who once challenged Americans to look at what they can do for their country.,"right"
Kennedy spoke Tuesday at the all-virtual Democratic National Convention about helping Barack Obama choose Biden as a running mate while on his vetting team and then seeing him in action as vice president.,"right"
Kennedy served as the U.S. ambassador to Japan during the Obama administration and said she saw Biden as a leader who was tough but fair and commanded the trust and respect of other nations.,"right"
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer made a pitch at the Democratic National Convention not just for Joe Biden, but for flipping control of the Senate to Democrats.,"right"
'œThat man is my friend Joe Biden.,"right"
She said Trump's Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, represented the best of the country and said America needed a president who respected its laws and 'œwould restore the soul of America.'ť,"right"
'œWe know Joe Biden.,"right"
America, we need Joe Biden,'ť said Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate.,"right"
The speakers contrasted Trump's leadership with that of Biden and their own, presenting the Democratic ticket as a safe choice for those who are worried.,"right"
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell plans to say at the Democratic National Convention that he supports Joe Biden for president because of the values they share.,"right"
In an advance clip of his speech Tuesday, Powell says that Biden shares 'œthe values I learned growing up in the South Bronx and serving in uniform'ť and that he supports him for president because 'œwe need to restore those values to the White House.'ť,"right"
Powell, who is a decorated four-star general, also says that the country 'œneeds a commander in chief who takes care of our troops in the same way he would his own family.'ť Powell says Biden knows how to do just that because his son Beau served in the Army National Guard.,"right"
Powell called President Donald Trump a liar and endorsed Biden in June.,"right"
On June 4, the Wall Street Journal published a story headlined, “Behind Closed Doors, Biden Shows Signs of Slipping.” Based on interviews with 45 people, the article reported that associates described President Joe Biden as showing signs of age, “a president who appears slower now, someone who has both good moments and bad ones.”,"right"
The Journal described a January White House meeting with congressional leaders on Ukraine policy in which Biden “spoke so softly at times that some participants struggled to hear him, according to five people familiar with the meeting.,"right"
Biden is as sharp as ever, Democrats said.,"right"
Murray's answer to her own question was obvious — she was accusing the Journal of publishing a partisan hit piece suggesting Biden is not up to the job when she, Murray, had told reporters Biden is as good as ever.,"right"
Later, the Journal would describe it this way: “Murray told the Journal in April that she hadn't seen a change in Biden's acuity during her years of working with him.,"right"
Now, after the disastrous June 27 debate exposed Biden's infirmities for the world to see, Murray is singing a different tune.,"right"
On Monday, a concerned-sounding Murray released a statement that began, “More than a week since the debate, and after talking with my constituents, I believe President Biden must do more to demonstrate he can campaign strong enough to beat Donald Trump.,"right"
At this critical time for our country, President Biden must seriously consider the best way to preserve his incredible legacy and secure it for the future.”,"right"
It doesn't take much reading between the lines to see that Murray is ready to show Biden the door — just weeks after she mocked the Wall Street Journal for even suggesting Biden can't handle the job.,"right"
The Murray episode shows how Democrats enabled Biden, even as the president became less and less able to hide his infirmities.,"right"
Remember that in her statement she predicated her new position on “talking with my constituents.” The debate, visible for all to see, made it impossible for Murray to play down Biden's condition any longer.,"right"
They're the ones who enabled Biden and the ones who brought presidential politics to its current impasse.,"right"
COLUMBUS, Ohio — Joe Biden and Donald Trump won their party's primaries in Illinois on Tuesday, notching more delegates as they continue their march to a rematch in this November's presidential election.,"right"
Biden, a Democrat, and Trump, a Republican, also easily won primaries Tuesday in Ohio.,"right"
There was no contest for Biden to win in Florida as Democrats there canceled their primary and opted to award all 224 of their delegates to him, a move that has precedence for an incumbent president.,"right"
Trump and Biden are also expected to easily win primaries Tuesday in Arizona and Kansas, banking more support after becoming their parties’ presumptive nominees last week.,"right"
Trump and Biden have for weeks been focused on the general election, aiming their campaigns lately on states that could be competitive in November rather than merely those holding primaries.,"right"
Biden, meanwhile, is visiting Nevada and Arizona on Tuesday, two states that were among the closest in 2020 and remain top priorities for both campaigns.,"right"
Trump and Biden are running on their records in office and casting the other as a threat to America.,"right"
Trump, 77, portrays the 81-year-old Biden as mentally unfit.,"right"
“President Biden, I don't think he knows how to tie his shoes anymore,” said Trump supporter Linda Bennet, a resident of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, not far from the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort.,"right"
Even as she echoed Trump's arguments about Biden, she criticized Trump's rhetoric and “the way he composes himself” as “not presidential at all.” But she said the former president is “a man of his word,” and she said the country, especially the economy, felt stronger to her under Trump's leadership.,"right"
In Columbus, Ohio, Democrat Brenda Woodfolk voted for Biden and shared the president's framing of the choice this fall.,"right"
Trump and Republicans have hammered Biden on the influx of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in recent years, seeking to capitalize on the issue well beyond border states.,"right"
Biden has ratcheted up a counteroffensive in recent weeks after Senate Republicans killed a migration compromise they had negotiated with the White House, withholding their support only after Trump said he opposed the deal.,"right"
Biden has used the circumstances to argue that Trump and Republicans have no interest in solving the issue but instead want to inflame voters in an election year.,"right"
WASHINGTON — The grinding war between Ukraine and its Russian invaders has escalated ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration, with President Joe Biden rushing out billions of dollars more in military aid before U.S. support for Kyiv’s defenses is thrown into question under the new administration.,"right"
The Biden administration is pushing every available dollar out the door to shore up Ukraine's defenses before leaving office in six weeks, announcing more than $2 billion in additional support since Trump won the presidential election last month.,"right"
The administration is on track to disperse the U.S. portion of a $50 billion loan to Ukraine, backed by frozen Russian assets, before Biden leaves the White House, U.S. officials said.,"right"
Biden also has eased limits on Ukraine using American longer-range missiles against military targets deeper inside Russia, following months of refusing those appeals over fears of provoking Russia into nuclear war or attacks on the West.,"right"
Biden and his senior advisers, however, are skeptical that allowing freer use of the longer-range missiles will change the broader trajectory of the war, according to two senior administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.,"right"
Even now, “the Biden administration has been very careful not to run up against the possibility of a defeated Putin or a defeated Russia” for fear of the tumult that could bring, said retired Gen.,"right"
He is critical of Biden’s cautious pace of military support for Ukraine.,"right"
Biden said it was further evidence that U.S. support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was wearing down Russia’s military.,"right"
Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to use longer-range missiles more broadly in Russia was partly in response, intended to discourage North Korea from deeper involvement in the war, one of the senior administration officials said.,"right"
After an election year filled with rancor and ultimately, voters’ rejection of the Biden administration, the White House is calling for a “Season of Peace & Light” with this year’s holiday theme.,"right"
“At the holidays, Americans come together every year in fellowship and faith, reminding us that we are stronger as a community than we are apart,” President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden wrote at the end of the holiday guidebook.,"right"
Fireplaces in each room emitted warmth and the sounds of popping wood during the preview, which was followed by an event for National Guard families, where Jill Biden gave remarks.,"right"
For the Biden family’s last Christmas in the People’s House, the emphasis is on tranquility.,"right"
This year’s friendly feeling is in keeping with past Biden White House displays, all of which have been an elevated version of what many do in their own homes, rather than a more haute presentation.,"right"
The Biden family’s first Christmas in the White House in 2021, which was scaled back because of the pandemic, had a “Gifts From the Heart” theme, with rooms designed to honor members of the military, front-line workers and first responders.,"right"
WASHINGTON — Hunter Biden was hired by a Romanian businessman accused of corruption who was trying to “influence U.S. government policy” during Joe Biden's term as vice president, prosecutors said in court papers Wednesday.,"right"
Special counsel David Weiss' team said Hunter Biden's business associate will testify at the upcoming federal tax trial of the president's son about the arrangement with the executive, Gabriel Popoviciu, who was facing criminal investigation at the time in Romania.,"right"
The allegations are likely to bring a fresh wave of criticism of Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, which have been the center of Republicans' investigations into the president's family.,"right"
Hunter Biden has blasted Republican inquiries into his family's business affairs as politically motivated, and has insisted he never involved his father in his business.,"right"
An attorney for Hunter Biden didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.,"right"
Prosecutors plan to introduce evidence that Hunter Biden and his business associate “received compensation from a foreign principal who was attempting to influence U.S. policy and public opinion,” according to the filing.,"right"
Popoviciu is identified only in court papers as G.P., but the details line up with information released in the congressional investigation and media reporting about Hunter Biden's legal work in Romania.,"right"
Prosecutors say Hunter Biden agreed with his business associate to help Popoviciu fight the criminal charges against him.,"right"
But prosecutors say they were concerned that “lobbying work might cause political ramifications” for Joe Biden, so the arrangement was structured in a way that “concealed the true nature of the work” for Popoviciu, prosecutors allege.,"right"
Hunter Biden's business associate and Popoviciu signed an agreement to make it look like Popoviciu's payments were for “management services to real estate prosperities in Romania.” However, prosecutors said, “That was not actually what G.P. was paying for.”,"right"
Hunter Biden's business associate was paid more than $3 million, which was split with Hunter and another business partner, prosecutors say.,"right"
The claims were made in court papers as prosecutors responded to a request by Hunter Biden's legal team to bar from his upcoming trial any reference to allegations of improper political influence that have dogged the president's son for years.,"right"
Hunter Biden's lawyers have said in court papers that he has been “the target of politically motivated attacks and conspiracy theories” about his foreign business dealings.,"right"
Hunter Biden's trial set to begin next month in Los Angeles centers on charges that he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years during a period in which he has acknowledged struggling with a drug addiction.,"right"
Prosecutors say they won't introduce any evidence that Hunter Biden was directly paid by a foreign government “or evidence that the defendant received compensation for actions taken by his father that impacted national or international politics.”,"right"
Still, prosecutors say what Hunter Biden agreed to do for Popoviciu is relevant at trial because it “demonstrates his state and mind and intent” during the years he's accused of failing to pay his taxes.,"right"
The tax trial comes months after Hunter Biden was convicted of three felony charges over the purchase of a gun in 2018.,"right"
Suburban Democratic leaders praised President Joe Biden as selfless and honorable for ending his reelection bid Sunday and lauded his accomplishments in office.,"right"
“President Biden’s policy achievements have already established his place as one of the most consequential presidents in American history,” U.S. Rep.,"right"
“Through his decision today, Joe Biden has demonstrated the true and selfless nature of a life committed to putting the country, and his fellow Americans, first.”,"right"
Brad Schneider, one of several House Democrats to call for Biden’s withdrawal from the race in recent weeks, thanked the president for his decision.,"right"
“Joe Biden has selflessly served our nation with courage, heart and honor,” Schneider said.,"right"
Tammy Duckworth of Hoffman Estates lauded Biden’s more than 50 years in public service, touting an “unparalleled record of accomplishments.” She cited Biden’s work on the Violence Against Women Act and the Affordable Care Act, as well as his efforts to guide the nation out of the COVID-19 pandemic, as examples.,"right"
“No one has done more for working Americans than Joe Biden — and so many of us owe him a debt of gratitude for everything he’s done to improve our country,” she said.,"right"
Illinois Republican Party Chair Kathy Salvi of Mundelein issued a blistering statement slamming Biden, his administration and Democrats as a whole.,"right"
“Today’s announcement is the culmination of years of lies from the Biden White House and Democrats shaming anyone who questioned the fitness of President Biden,” she said.,"right"
Republican congressional candidate Jerry Evans said Biden should resign as president if he's not up to leading or running for reelection.,"right"
“The only question left is, Does Bill Foster think Biden is still fit to continue to serve?”,"right"
Foster declined to address Evans’ remarks and instead said Biden’s decision to step down as presidential nominee “will be counted among the most selfless acts of patriotism as any leader in American history.”,"right"
While Biden’s decision leaves the Democrats without a presidential candidate, likely until next month’s party convention in Chicago, he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the post.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Congress to “show some spine” and stand up to Donald Trump even as a Senate deal on border enforcement measures and Ukraine aid rapidly collapsed.,"right"
The split-screen moments in Washington represented a swift turn of events that showed McConnell’s slipping control of his GOP conference, Trump’s growing influence, and Biden’s ability only to look on as a cornerstone of his foreign policy — halting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s advance into Europe — crumbled in Congress.,"right"
Biden had engaged for months on a carefully negotiated plan to pair policies intended to curb illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border with $60 billion in wartime aid for Ukraine.,"right"
Biden laid blame for the bill's demise squarely on Trump — his likely Republican opponent in the November presidential election.,"right"
“For the last 24 hours he’s done nothing, I’m told, but reach out to Republicans in the House and the Senate and threaten them and try to intimidate them to vote against this proposal,” Biden said.,"right"
“Every week, every month that passes without new aid to Ukraine means fewer artillery shells, fewer air defense systems, fewer tools for Ukraine to defend itself against this Russian onslaught,” Biden said.,"right"
The lack of a national security deal will loom large over Biden’s Friday meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.,"right"
Biden plans to underscore to Scholz that he remains committed to providing Ukraine the funding it needs to continue to repel the nearly two-year old Russian invasion.,"right"
McConnell said in an earlier floor speech that it was essential to assert American strength in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, yet also blamed Biden for not responding sooner to threats from rival powers.,"right"
But Republicans have largely heeded the wishes of Trump to reject the bill because it would show that Biden could act to address problems at the border, which is seen as one of his largest vulnerabilities in his reelection campaign.,"right"
President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are taking part in Thursday night's debate in Atlanta.,"right"
Trump also faces an indictment in Georgia for his push to “find 11,780 votes” and overturn Biden’s victory based on false or unproven theories of voter fraud.,"right"
Two candidates — Biden and Trump — will be on stage.,"right"
Biden’s campaign had proposed excluding third-party candidates, such as Robert F.,"right"
Biden didn’t debate any of the Democrats challenging him, either.,"right"
Last month, Biden announced that he would not participate in fall presidential debates sponsored by the nonpartisan commission that has organized them for more than three decades.,"right"
Hours later, Biden said he had accepted an invitation from CNN, adding, “Over to you, Donald.” Trump, who had insisted he would debate Biden anytime and anyplace, said on Truth Social he’d be there, too, adding, “Let’s get ready to Rumble!!!” Soon after that, they agreed to a second debate.,"right"
It wasn't really a surprise that President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he will no longer be a candidate for a second term.,"right"
After all, Biden was under crushing pressure from some of the most powerful forces in the Democratic Party — congressional leaders, fundraisers, former President Barack Obama, and especially former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.,"right"
In the time-honored Washington way, once Biden relented and stepped aside, people who just hours earlier had their boot on his neck raced to express their heartfelt respect and admiration for his judgment, selflessness and patriotism.,"right"
Before Biden's decision, there was a lot of talk about possible replacements at the top of the ticket — not just Harris but Michigan Gov.,"right"
But once Biden withdrew, there was a stampede to Harris.,"right"
By early March, she had climbed to third place in the 20-plus-candidate field, with 12% support, behind only Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, according to a CNN poll.,"right"
By late April — using the CNN poll throughout — she had slipped to sixth place, with 5% support, behind Biden, Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke, according to the same poll.,"right"
By late June, though, she had shot up to 17% support, behind only Biden.,"right"
In a June 27 debate, Harris attacked Biden for Biden's opposition of mandatory school busing nearly 50 years earlier, in the early 1970s.,"right"
“There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day,” Harris said to Biden.,"right"
And on other issues, as an MSNBC commentator noted Monday, beyond attacking Donald Trump, Harris in 2020 “struggled to affirmatively say what she stood for.” She was, in short, a terrible candidate who improbably ended up as Biden's running mate and then vice president of the United States.,"right"
Now that Biden's infirmities have finally caught up with him, Harris appears to have the inside track to the Democratic presidential nomination.,"right"
ATLANTA — A raspy President Joe Biden repeatedly sought to confront Donald Trump in their first debate ahead of the November election, as his Republican rival countered Biden's criticism by leaning into falsehoods about the economy, illegal immigration and his role in the Jan.,"right"
Biden’s uneven performance risked crystallizing voter concerns that at age 81 he is too old to serve as president, while Trump’s rhetoric offered a perhaps unwelcome reminder of the bombast he launched daily during his tumultuous four years in office.,"right"
Biden entered the debate looking to sharpen the choice voters will face in November.,"right"
6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol to try to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden.,"right"
After he was prompted by a moderator to answer whether he violated his oath of office that day by rallying his supporters seeking to block the certification of Biden's Electoral College victory and not doing enough to call them off as they stormed the Capitol, Trump sought to blame then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.,"right"
Biden said Trump encouraged the supporters to go to the Capitol and sat in the White House without taking action as they fought with police officers.,"right"
“He didn’t do a damn thing and these people should be in jail,” Biden said.,"right"
Trump then defended the people convicted and imprisoned for their role in the insurrection, saying to Biden, “What they’ve done to some people that are so innocent, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.”,"right"
Biden began the night with a raspy voice and a halting delivery as he tried to defend his economic record and criticize Trump.,"right"
Biden appeared to lose his train of thought while giving one answer, drifting from an answer on tax policy to health policy, at one point using the word “COVID,” and then saying, “excuse me, with, dealing with,” and he trailed off again.,"right"
“Look, we finally beat Medicare,” Biden said, as his time ran out on his answer.,"right"
Trump falsely suggested Biden was weakening the social service program because of migrants coming into the country illegally.,"right"
Trump and Biden entered the night facing stiff headwinds, including a public weary of the tumult of partisan politics and broadly dissatisfied with both, according to polling.,"right"
Biden got personal in evoking his son, Beau, who served in Iraq before dying of brain cancer.,"right"
The president criticized Trump for reportedly calling Americans killed in battle “suckers and losers.” Biden told Trump, “My son was not a loser, was not a sucker.,"right"
Trump said he never said that and slammed Biden for the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan.,"right"
Biden directly mentioned Trump’s conviction in the New York hush money trial, saying, “You have the morals of an alley cat," and referencing the allegations in the case that Trump had sex with a porn actress.,"right"
Trump retorted that Biden could face criminal charges “when he leaves office.” Trump said, though there is no evidence of any wrongdoing, “Joe could be a convicted felon with all the things that he’s done.” He added of the president, “this man is a criminal.”,"right"
Biden insisted that Trump was more focused on “retribution” against his political rivals than leading the nation.,"right"
Pressed to defend rising inflation since he took office, Biden pinned it on the situation he inherited from Trump amid the COVID-19 pandemic.,"right"
Biden said that when Trump left office, “things were in chaos.” Trump disagreed, declaring that during his term in the White House, “Everything was rocking good.”,"right"
Wade decision and returned the issue of abortion restrictions to individual states, which is what “everybody wanted.” Biden countered that abortion access was settled for 50 years and that Trump was making it harder for women in large swaths of the country to get access to basic health care.,"right"
At one point, Trump defended his record on foreign policy and blamed Biden for the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, suggesting the conflicts broke out when the aggressors felt free to attack because they perceived Biden as weak.,"right"
“I never heard so much malarkey in my whole life,” Biden retorted.,"right"
Trump skipped Biden’s inauguration after leading an unprecedented and unsuccessful effort to overturn his loss that culminated in the Jan.,"right"
Trump has promised sweeping plans to remake the U.S. government if he returns to the White House and Biden argues that his opponent would pose an existential threat to the nation’s democracy.,"right"
Aiming to avoid a repeat of their chaotic 2020 matchups, Biden insisted — and Trump agreed — to hold the debate without an audience and to allow the network to mute the candidates’ microphones when it is not their turn to speak.,"right"
Heading out of the debate, both Biden and Trump will travel to states they hope to swing their way this fall.,"right"
Biden is set to jet off to North Carolina, where he is expected to hold the largest-yet rally of his campaign in a state Trump narrowly carried in 2020.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden, in an open letter to congressional Democrats, stood firm Monday against calls for him to drop his reelection candidacy and called for an end to the intraparty drama that has torn apart Democrats since his dismal public debate performance.,"right"
Biden's efforts to shore up a deeply anxious Democratic Party came as lawmakers returned to Washington confronting a choice: Work to revive his campaign or try to edge out the party leader, a make-or-break time for his campaign and their own political futures.,"right"
Biden wrote in the two-page letter that “the question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now.,"right"
“We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election,” Biden said in the letter, distributed by his reelection campaign.,"right"
Anxiety is running high as top-ranking Democratic lawmakers are joining calls for Biden to step aside despite his defiance.,"right"
At the same time, some of the president’s most staunch supporters are redoubling the fight for Biden’s presidency, insisting there’s no one better to beat Trump in what many see as among the most important elections of a lifetime.,"right"
Biden followed up the letter with a phone interview with MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” show, in which he insisted that “average Democrats” want him to stay in the race and said he was frustrated by the calls from party officials for him to step aside.,"right"
“They’re big names, but I don’t care what those big names think,” Biden said.,"right"
Later, Biden joined a call with members of his national finance committee, while first lady Jill Biden campaigned for her husband in a three-state swing focused on engaging veterans and military families.,"right"
Democratic voters are split on whether Biden should remain the Democratic Party’s nominee for president, or whether there should be a different Democratic nominee, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll.,"right"
Pramila Jayapal, who was not ready to cast aside Biden, saying that the threat of a second Trump presidency remains too high.,"right"
Jon Tester of Montana, said in a statement, “President Biden has got to prove to the American people—including me—that he’s up to the job for another four years.”,"right"
However, Biden’s letter left some House Democrats, who want to hear directly from Biden himself, furious, according to one House aide granted anonymity to discuss the situation.,"right"
Biden planned to meet virtually Monday with the Congressional Black Caucus — one of his staunchest blocs of supporters in Congress.,"right"
The White House would not say whether Biden would meet with all Democratic lawmakers in person at the Capitol this week.,"right"
Meanwhile, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden had undergone three neurological exams while in the White House as part of his annual physical exams — and no more — and said the president has not been diagnosed with or treated for Parkinson’s.,"right"
Democrats who have worked alongside Biden for years — if not decades — and cherished his life's work on policy priorities are now entertaining uncomfortable questions about his political future.,"right"
And it's unfolding as Biden hosts world leaders for the NATO summit this week in Washington.,"right"
Many Democrats are arguing the attention needs to be focused not on Biden but on the former president's felony conviction in the hush money case and pending federal charges in his effort to overturn the 2020 election.,"right"
Mark Takano of California — privately said Biden should step aside.,"right"
Many others on the call raised concerns about Biden’s capability and chance of winning reelection, even if they stopped short of saying Biden should step out of the race.,"right"
Smith the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, went public Monday with his call for Biden to step aside, saying it would be “a mistake” if Biden continues his campaign.,"right"
"I’m calling on President Biden to step down,” Smith said on social media.,"right"
Bobby Scott of Virginia, both leaders in the Congressional Black Caucus, spoke forcefully in support of Biden, as did Rep.,"right"
Neal said afterward that the bottom line is Biden beat Trump in 2020 and “he’ll do it again in November.”,"right"
Biden’s allies said they expected more direct engagement from the president with lawmakers — like the CBC virtual meeting — as he scrambles to shore up his candidacy.,"right"
On a call Saturday with his campaign co-chairs, Biden repeatedly asked them, who else needs to hear from him, who else he needs to engage with and who still has unanswered questions or concerns, according to Sen.,"right"
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer would not answer questions about Biden’s reelection as he entered the Capitol on Monday, but he told reporters: “As I’ve said before, I’m for Joe.”,"right"
Mark Warner of Virginia, had intended to gather senators Monday to discuss Biden privately, but a person familiar with his thinking said those conversations will take place in Tuesday’s regular caucus luncheon with all Democratic senators.,"right"
BETHESDA, Md. — President Joe Biden is visiting Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Wednesday for his annual physical exam — and the results are sure to be closely watched as the 81-year-old president seeks reelection.,"right"
Biden is already the oldest president in U.S. history and would be 86 by the end of a second term, should he win one.,"right"
After his last physical, performed in February 2023, doctors declared Biden “healthy, vigorous” and “fit” to handle his White House duties.,"right"
But voters are approaching this year’s election with misgivings about Biden’s age, having scrutinized his gaffes, his coughing, his slow walking and even a tumble off his bicycle.,"right"
“I'm going to Walter Reed to get my physical,” Biden told reporters as he left the White House, which said it will release a written summary of the “routine” checkup later in the day.,"right"
Former President Donald Trump, 77, is the favorite to lock up the Republican nomination later this month, which would bring him closer to a November rematch against Biden.,"right"
Trump was 70 when he took office in 2017, which made him the oldest American president to be inaugurated, until Biden broke his record by being inaugurated at 78 in 2021.,"right"
A recent special counsel’s report investigating Biden's possession of classified documents repeatedly derided Biden's memory, calling it “hazy,” “fuzzy,” “faulty,” “poor” and having “significant limitations.” It also noted that Biden could not recall defining milestones in his own life such as when his son Beau died or when he served as vice president.,"right"
But addressing reporters the evening of the report's release, Biden said "my memory is fine” and grew visibly angry as he denied forgetting when his son died of brain cancer in 2015 at the age of 46.,"right"
Testing of memory and cognitive skills are not usually part of routine physicals like the one Biden is underdoing.,"right"
His last physical showed that the president had a lesion removed from his chest over the previous year, but the results then otherwise largely matched the findings after Biden's previous exam in November 2021.,"right"
Biden had a colonoscopy in 2021, in which a 3 millimeter “benign-appearing polyp” was identified and removed.,"right"
In 1988, Biden had surgery to repair two brain aneurysms, which are weak bulges in arteries, and one of them leaking.,"right"
Biden has never had a recurrence, his doctor said, citing a test in 2014 that examined his arteries.,"right"
Many Americans, including Democrats, have expressed reservations about Biden seeking a second term during this fall's election.,"right"
Only 37% of Democrats say Biden should pursue reelection, down from 52% before the 2022 midterm elections, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.,"right"
Biden won Michigan's Democratic primary handily on Tuesday, but an “uncommitted” campaign organized by activists disillusioned with the president's handling of the war in Gaza far surpassed the 10,000-vote margin by which Trump won Michigan in 2016.,"right"
That was a goal set by organizers and it was seen as a potential source of embarrassment for Biden's reelection campaign.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is making thousands of people who were convicted of use and simple possession of marijuana on federal lands and in the District of Columbia eligible for pardons, the White House said Friday, in his latest round of executive clemencies meant to rectify racial disparities in the justice system.,"right"
Biden is also granting clemency to 11 people serving what the White House called “disproportionately long” sentences for nonviolent drug offenses.,"right"
Biden, in a statement, said his actions would help make the “promise of equal justice a reality.”,"right"
“Criminal records for marijuana use and possession have imposed needless barriers to employment, housing, and educational opportunities,” Biden said.,"right"
Biden's order applies only to marijuana, which has been decriminalized or legalized in many states for some or all uses, but remains a controlled substance under federal law.,"right"
Biden on Friday reiterated his call on governors and local leaders to take similar steps to erase marijuana convictions.,"right"
“Just as no one should be in a federal prison solely due to the use or possession of marijuana, no one should be in a local jail or state prison for that reason, either,” Biden said.,"right"
In a statement, President Joe Biden cited the tragedy in calling on Congress to pass universal background checks, a national red flag law and certain gun restrictions.,"right"
“We can never accept senseless violence that traumatizes children, their families, and tears entire communities apart,” Biden said.,"right"
WASHINGTON (AP) - The super PAC urging Vice President Joe Biden to run for president pulled its first television ad off the air Thursday after Biden signaled he preferred that it not run.,"right"
One day after releasing the ad recalling Biden's family tragedies and vowing to spend six figures to air it on national television, Draft Biden abruptly reversed course.,"right"
Josh Alcorn, a senior adviser to the super PAC and a Biden family friend, said nobody respects Biden and his family more than Draft Biden.,"right"
The super PAC's inaugural ad featured audio from a speech Biden gave at Yale University in May, just a few weeks before his eldest son, Beau Biden, died of brain cancer.,"right"
In the ad, Biden recalls the car crash that killed his wife and daughter just after he was first elected senator in 1972, and says he found redemption by focusing on his sons.,"right"
The ad drew criticism from Democrats and some Biden supporters for appearing to exploit his personal losses for political gain.,"right"
Draft Biden announced plans to pull the ad almost immediately after word emerged in a Los Angeles Times report that Biden had seen the ad and hoped it wouldn't run.,"right"
Two people close to Biden confirmed to The Associated Press that Biden and his staff felt the ad was inappropriate and in poor taste.,"right"
In public comments since his son's death, Biden has emphasized that his losses are no worse than those experienced by many Americans, and that he deserves no special sympathy.,"right"
Although Draft Biden is an independent group and legally barred from coordinating with a campaign, it has attracted a number of supporters with close and longstanding ties to Biden and President Barack Obama.,"right"
Alcorn, who joined the group over the summer and is steering its activities, was previously the political director for Beau Biden, who served as Delaware's attorney general.,"right"
Biden has said he's considering entering the presidential race, but has yet to make a decision - to the dismay of ardent supporters calling for him to run.,"right"
Earlier this week, Biden's office pushed back aggressively against suggestions that Biden leaked word to a newspaper columnist of his son's dying wish for him to run in an attempt to galvanize political support.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will host President-elect Donald Trump for a traditional postelection meeting in the Oval Office on Wednesday, the White House said Saturday.,"right"
But Trump, a Republican, did not host Biden, a Democrat, for a sit-down after the 2020 election, when Trump lost his reelection bid.,"right"
The White House said Biden called Trump this past Wednesday to congratulate him and invite him to meet in the Oval Office.,"right"
In a speech Thursday, Biden said he had assured Trump “that I would direct my entire administration to work with his team to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition.,"right"
A thank you to your columnist Michael Barone for laying out the facts of the Biden's administration's efforts to pass recent immigration reform.,"right"
Biden has had the power of executive orders to get this reform done for years now.,"right"
Instead, the Democrats opened the border floodgates three years ago when Biden took office.,"right"
President Joe Biden issued a full and unconditional pardon to his son, Hunter, who was awaiting sentencing after been convicted of multiple federal crimes.,"right"
Biden had claimed for more than a year that he would not intervene in his son's case out of respect for the criminal justice system.,"right"
Ironically, the pardoning of Hunter Biden undoubtedly further weakened the faith that Americans have in that system.,"right"
The liberal media is playing along with the laughable claim by the White House that Biden — in the twilight of his presidency — suddenly changed his mind about a pardon.,"right"
Biden just couldn't say so during an election year because he was afraid of blowback.,"right"
Biden's big mistake was going too far in the opposite direction and proclaiming over and over again — both directly and through White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre — that he would not pardon his son.,"right"
Now, as far as many Americans are concerned, it looks like Biden was lying the whole time.,"right"
When I heard about Biden's pardon, I immediately gave into “whataboutism" and recalled the controversial pardons that President-elect Donald Trump — who has been convicted of 34 counts and might have needed a pardon himself had he lost the election — doled out during his first term.,"right"
Is it too late for Biden to nominate Hunter to be U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain?,"right"
It became ever clearer President Joe Biden was on a glidepath to the Democratic nomination that only some kind of personal catastrophe could alter.,"right"
Enthusiasm for Biden was not the story of the day, with some Democrats even voting “uncommitted” rather than for the incumbent.,"right"
What has been obvious for weeks, is now beyond reasonable dispute: Biden and Trump are the overwhelming favorites to face each other in November.,"right"
Biden, on the other hand, faces a lack of Democratic enthusiasm on paper, but not in the primary.,"right"
But Biden, who hasn’t faced any significant challengers, has won his primaries by huge margins.,"right"
On his fourth try, Joe Biden finally won Iowa.,"right"
For decades, Biden had been rejected by its voters, from his first abortive run in the 1988 cycle to 2020, when he finished a distant fourth.,"right"
This time, Iowa wasn't first and it was a primary, not a caucus, and Biden won easily.,"right"
WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden on Tuesday formally announced that he is running for reelection in 2024, asking voters to give him more time to "finish this job" and extend the run of America's oldest president for another four years.,"right"
Biden, who would be 86 at the end of a second term, is betting his first-term legislative achievements and more than 50 years of experience in Washington will count for more than concerns over his age.,"right"
In his first public appearance Tuesday since the announcement, Biden offered a preview of how he plans to navigate the dual roles of president and presidential candidate, using a speech to building trades union members to highlight his accomplishments and undercut his GOP rivals, while showing voters he remained focused on his day job.,"right"
Greeted by a raucous crowd of building trades union members - a key base of Democratic support - with "Let's Go Joe" chants, Biden touted the tens of thousands of construction jobs being created since he took office that are supported by the legislation he signed into law.,"right"
"We - you and I - together we're turning things around and we're doing it in a big way," Biden said.,"right"
The official announcement, in a three-minute video, comes on the four-year anniversary of when Biden declared for the White House in 2019, promising to heal the "soul of the nation" amid the turbulent presidency of Donald Trump - a goal that has remained elusive.,"right"
"I said we are in a battle for the soul of America, and we still are," Biden said.,"right"
While the prospect of seeking reelection has been a given for most modern presidents, that's not always been the case for Biden.,"right"
A notable swath of Democratic voters have indicated they would prefer he not run, in part because of his age - concerns Biden has called "totally legitimate" but ones he did not address head-on in the launch video.,"right"
And Biden's political standing within his party stabilized after Democrats notched a stronger-than-expected performance in last year's midterm elections.,"right"
Nothing more sacred," Biden said in the launch video, depicting Republican extremists as trying to roll back access to abortion, cut Social Security, limit voting rights and ban books they disagree with.,"right"
"This is not a time to be complacent," Biden added.,"right"
As the contours of the campaign begin to take shape, Biden plans to campaign on his record.,"right"
With Republicans now in control of the House, Biden has shifted his focus to implementing those massive laws and making sure voters credit him for the improvements.,"right"
I know we can," Biden said in the video, repeating a mantra he said a dozen times during his State of the Union address in February, listing everything from passing a ban on assault-style weapons and lowering the cost of prescription drugs to codifying a national right to abortion after the Supreme Court's ruling last year overturning Roe v.,"right"
Buoyed by the midterm results, Biden plans to continue to cast all Republicans as embracing what he calls "ultra-MAGA" politics - a reference to Trump's "Make America Great Again" slogan - regardless of whether his predecessor ends up on the 2024 ballot.,"right"
In the video, Biden speaks over brief clips and photographs of key moments in his presidency, snapshots of diverse Americans and flashes of outspoken Republican foes, including Trump, Florida Gov.,"right"
Biden also plans to point to his work over the past two years shoring up American alliances, leading a global coalition to support Ukraine's defenses against Russia's invasion and returning the U.S. to the Paris climate accord.,"right"
As a candidate in 2020, Biden pitched voters on his familiarity with the halls of power in Washington and his relationships around the world.,"right"
"Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else," Biden said in March 2020, as he campaigned in Michigan with younger Democrats, including now-Vice President Kamala Harris, Sen.,"right"
Three years later, the president now 80, Biden allies say his time in office has demonstrated that he saw himself as more of a transformational than a transitional leader.,"right"
Still, many Democrats would prefer that Biden didn't run again.,"right"
And Biden's verbal - and occasional physical - stumbles have become fodder for critics trying to cast him as unfit for office.,"right"
Biden, on multiple occasions, has brushed back concerns about his age, saying simply, "Watch me.","right"
Aides acknowledge that while some in his party might prefer an alternative to Biden, there is anything but consensus within their diverse coalition on who that might be.,"right"
And they insist that when Biden is compared with whomever the GOP nominates, Democrats and independents will rally around Biden.,"right"
To prevail again, Biden will need the alliance of young voters and Black voters - particularly women - along with blue-collar Midwesterners, moderates and disaffected Republicans who helped him win in 2020.,"right"
Biden's reelection bid comes as the nation weathers uncertain economic crosscurrents.,"right"
"If voters let Biden 'finish the job,' inflation will continue to skyrocket, crime rates will rise, more fentanyl will cross our open borders, children will continue to be left behind, and American families will be worse off," Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.,"right"
Biden's announcement is roughly consistent with the timeline followed by then-President Barack Obama, who waited until April 2011 to declare for a second term and didn't hold a reelection rally until May 2012.,"right"
Biden is not expected to dramatically alter his day-to-day schedule as a candidate - at least not immediately - with aides believing his strongest political asset is showing the American people that he is governing.,"right"
On Tuesday, Biden named White House adviser Julie Chávez Rodríguez to serve as campaign manager and Quentin Fulks, who ran Sen.,"right"
Fresh off the campaign announcement, Biden is set to host South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol for a state visit at the White House and plans to meet with party donors in Washington later this week.,"right"
Follow the AP's coverage of President Joe Biden at https://apnews.com/hub/joe-biden.,"right"
The guilty verdict may not be good news for President Joe Biden.,"right"
As for Biden, sure, the 81-year-old will be running against a convicted felon — but that feeds into Trump's pose as a victim of a “rigged” system and an underdog.,"right"
Hunter Biden, a Yale Law graduate, also faces charges of tax evasion.,"right"
As the drama of President-elect Trump’s cabinet picks unfolds, we might take a minute to appreciate the stability and the competence of the Biden cabinet.,"right"
21, 2021, the day after President Biden’s inauguration, and March 24, 2021, — essentially two months — almost every member of the president’s cabinet had their hearings and were confirmed in bipartisan votes.,"right"
For many, the legacy of the Biden administration will be the withdrawal from Afghanistan, inflation, the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, the chaos at the southern border and his pardon of his son.,"right"
Swinging by the office of her attorney in Los Angeles, she dropped off required paperwork for the Biden administration's new immigration policy that could finally give her husband, Roberto, legal residency as the spouse of an American citizen.,"right"
These families should not be needlessly separated,” President Joe Biden said in a statement Monday.,"right"
All I did was make it possible for these long-time residents to file the paperwork here – together with their families," Biden added.,"right"
NEW YORK — President Joe Biden declared in his final address to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday that the U.S. must not retreat from the world, as Israel and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon edged toward all-out war and Israel’s bloody operation against Hamas in Gaza neared the one-year mark.,"right"
Biden used his wide-ranging address to speak to a need to end the Middle East conflict and the 17-month-old civil war in Sudan and to highlight U.S. and Western allies' support for Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.,"right"
His appearance before the international body offered Biden one of his last high-profile opportunities as president to make the case to keep up robust support for Ukraine, which could be in doubt if former President Donald Trump defeats Vice President Kamala Harris in November.,"right"
Biden insisted that despite global conflicts, he remains hopeful for the future.,"right"
“I’ve seen a remarkable sweep of history," Biden said.,"right"
Biden came to office promising to rejuvenate U.S. relations around the world and to extract the U.S. from“forever wars” in Afghanistan and Iraq that consumed American foreign policy over the last 20 years.,"right"
“I was determined to end it, and I did,” Biden said of the Afghanistan exit, calling it a “hard decision but the right decision.” He acknowledged that it was "accompanied by tragedy” with the deaths of 13 American troops and hundreds of Afghans in a suicide bombing during the chaotic withdrawal.,"right"
“There will always be forces that pull our countries apart,” Biden said, rejecting “a desire to retreat from the world and go it alone.” He said, "Our task, our test, is to make sure that the forces holding us together are stronger than the forces pulling us apart.”,"right"
“Full scale war is not in anyone’s interest,” Biden said, and despite escalating violence, a diplomatic solution is the only path to peace.,"right"
Biden had a hopeful outlook for the Middle East when he addressed the U.N. just a year ago.,"right"
In that speech, Biden spoke of a “sustainable, integrated Middle East” coming into view.,"right"
Biden's team helped resolve a long-running Israel-Lebanon maritime dispute that had held back gas exploration in the region.,"right"
“I suffer from an oxymoron: Irish optimism,” Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when they met on the sidelines of last year's U.N. gathering.,"right"
Eighteen days later, Biden's Middle East hopes came crashing down.,"right"
Now, the conflict is threatening to metastasize into a multi-front war and leave a lasting scar on Biden's presidential legacy.,"right"
Biden reiterated his call on the parties to agree to a cease-fire and hostage release deal, saying it's time to "end this war" — even as hopes for such a deal are fading as the conflict drags on.,"right"
Biden, in his address, called for the sustainment of Western support for Ukraine in its war with Russia.,"right"
Biden helped galvanize an international coalition to back Ukraine with weapons and economic aid in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's February 2022 assault on Ukraine.,"right"
“We cannot grow weary," Biden said.,"right"
Biden has managed to keep up American support in the face of rising skepticism from some Republican lawmakers — and Trump — about the cost of the conflict.,"right"
At the same time, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is pressing Biden to loosen restrictions on the use of Western-supplied long-range missiles so that Ukrainian forces can hit deeper in Russia.,"right"
Biden and Harris are scheduled to hold separate meetings with Zelenskyy in Washington on Thursday.,"right"
Biden struck a wistful tone in his remarks, peppering his speech with references to his first time attending the General Assembly more than 50 years ago, and quoting Irish poetry.,"right"
Biden held up his decision to step aside up as an instructive moment as he addressed a gathering that has no small share of totalitarian and nondemocratic leaders.,"right"
“Some things are more important than staying in power," Biden said.,"right"
President Joe Biden has said he will not pardon his son Hunter, who pleaded guilty to nine felony and misdemeanor tax charges Thursday in Los Angeles.,"right"
I hope Biden relents on his no-pardon pledge before the younger Biden spends a night behind bars.,"right"
If Hunter Biden goes to prison, know that family members of Republican politicians will be considered fair game.,"right"
I'm no fan of Hunter Biden.,"right"
Consider the statement Hunter Biden released Thursday:,"right"
In the end, Hunter Biden faces a life sentence being Hunter Biden.,"right"
So maybe Trump should make the first move by promising to pardon Hunter Biden if his father fails to do so.,"right"
J.B. Pritzker said Tuesday he is “all in” for President Joe Biden after visiting the White House last week with other Democratic governors.,"right"
Pritzker headed to Washington, D.C., to meet with the president and members of the Democratic Governors Association last Wednesday on the heels of Biden’s performance during the first of two scheduled debates with former President Donald Trump, which raised concerns about the president’s mental acuity.,"right"
The governors were seeking reassurances of Biden’s viability as a candidate following the June 27 debate performance.,"right"
On Tuesday, Pritzker said the exchange between Biden and the Democratic governors was “a robust discussion” — and he’s “all in” for Biden.,"right"
“Listen: Joe Biden is our nominee.,"right"
I am for Joe Biden.,"right"
I've been campaigning for Joe Biden.,"right"
I think you've seen I've got dates scheduled to go to Indiana, to Ohio for Joe Biden,” he said.,"right"
Pritzker, who frequently is named as a potential Biden replacement, will speak Friday at the Indiana Democratic Party’s Hoosier Hospitality Dinner in Indianapolis before heading at the Ohio Democratic Party’s Family Reunion in Columbus on Saturday.,"right"
He said he wouldn’t engage in “hypotheticals” when asked if he’d be interested in replacing Biden should the president drop out of the race.,"right"
“What we're doing is talking about why it's important to reelect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and why it's important to defeat Donald Trump, who's trying to take away your freedoms, who's trying to send jobs overseas, and frankly, would be bad for the economy and bad for working families,” Pritzker said.,"right"
You know, some people came away with different impressions, maybe,” Pritzker said of Biden’s meeting with the governors.,"right"
But despite some members of Congress calling for Biden to step aside — including U.S. Rep.,"right"
He added that his advice to Biden was to “go out there and answer all the questions,” and to “show people that he is the leader of the free world.”,"right"
It was a similar comment to one he made in a CNN interview last week in which he suggested Biden do more public appearances to turn the tide following the debate.,"right"
19-22 in Chicago, but Democrats plan to nominate Biden prior to that date virtually — a move that is needed to ensure he can appear on the Ohio ballot.,"right"
The Biden administration is preparing to finalize sweeping rules in coming weeks governing how sex discrimination is addressed in schools, including new protections for transgender students.,"right"
Athletics is among the thorniest issues confronting supporters of transgender rights, including those in the Biden administration.,"right"
The Biden administration’s proposed regulation, published in April 2023, took a nuanced approach.,"right"
Nonetheless, issuing such a rule risks injecting the issue into an election year in which President Biden faces a close contest with former President Donald Trump, who has promised to ban trans women from women’s sports if reelected.,"right"
“Folks close to Biden have made the political decision to not move on the athletics [regulation] preelection,” said one person familiar with the administration’s thinking.,"right"
“The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring all students are guaranteed an educational environment free from discrimination on the basis of sex,” the department official said.,"right"
“Especially in the midst of this aggressive attack on transgender and gender expansive youth, the administration cannot employ a piecemeal approach when protecting LGBTQIA students,” said a letter to Biden this month signed by more than 80 advocacy groups focused on women’s and LGBTQ+ rights and abortion access.,"right"
But while he favors finalizing the rules quickly, others said the Biden strategy makes sense politically.,"right"
As a candidate in 2020, President Biden signaled he would replace the regulation, and early in his term, he directed the Education Department to begin the laborious process of reviewing and ultimately writing a new set of rules.,"right"
Under the proposed Biden version, neither court-like hearings nor cross-examinations would be required.,"right"
The Biden version would also include protections against discrimination related to pregnancy.,"right"
What would a Joe Biden presidency mean for the men and women of law enforcement and the people they're sworn to protect?,"right"
Let's get this out of the way first: Despite claims to the contrary, Joe Biden does not support defunding the police.,"right"
Biden quickly dismissed the idea and instead offered a plan to invest $300 million more in community policing programs.,"right"
“Every single police department should have the money it needs to institute real reforms like adopting a national use of force standard, buying body cameras and recruiting more diverse police officers,” Biden wrote in an op-ed column published by USA Today in June.,"right"
While many of his current proposals align with the agendas of reform advocates, Biden has been sharply criticized for his central role in the passage of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act in 1994.,"right"
During last week's second and final debate, Biden called the act “a mistake.”,"right"
Biden has earned praise for co-sponsoring the 1994 Violence Against Women Act, which provides funding for victim services, prevents use of past sexual behavior against complainants in a rape case, makes state protective orders enforceable nationwide, provides legal aid for survivors of domestic violence and created the Office on Violence Against Women within the Department of Justice.,"right"
The truth is, whether former President Donald Trump had been found innocent and President Joe Biden’s son Hunter guilty, or Hunter innocent and Trump guilty, or both innocent, the system would still deserve our faith.,"right"
We suspect that Hunter Biden’s conviction on three felonies on Tuesday won’t convince the most die-hard Trump supporters that Trump’s recent trial wasn’t “rigged,” and a “sham” as he has said — and that the trial wasn’t led by a “conflicted” and “corrupt” judge.,"right"
But Biden’s trial and swift conviction on the three federal charges — all tied to his 2018 purchase of a gun — clearly has taken some wind out of the sails of the far-right narrative that Democrats have “weaponized” the American justice system for their own benefit.,"right"
After all, the argument goes, if the Democrats controlled the system, then isn’t it likely that neither Hunter Biden nor New Jersey Sen.,"right"
These last few weeks, it has been discouraging to see how supporters of Donald Trump and Hunter Biden, or anyone overly political, are unable to divorce their politics from how the trial court system works in this country.,"right"
Given the deeply honed mistrust of the American justice system these days, including the claim that the Biden Administration and Justice Department are making a political persecution of Trump, it feels a little bit like a miracle when 12 ordinary men and women emerge from deliberation with a unanimous verdict.,"right"
The president’s son, Hunter Biden: Guilty of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on a federal firearm application and possession of an illegally obtained gun.,"right"
Biden even may be able to point to the Supreme Court’s recent series of gun-friendly rulings.,"right"
People close to Trump and Hunter Biden are no doubt disappointed by how the juries saw the evidence in their cases.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he strongly supports a proposal from House Speaker Mike Johnson to provide aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.,"right"
Shortly after Johnson released the funding proposals, Democrat Biden offered his support for the package.,"right"
The House's version of the aid bill pushes the Biden administration to provide long-range ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) to Ukraine, which could be used to target Russian supply lines.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden has made some strong claims over the past few days about shutting down the U.S.-Mexico border as he tries to salvage a border deal in Congress that would also unlock money for Ukraine.,"right"
“A bipartisan bill would be good for America and help fix our broken immigration system and allow speedy access for those who deserve to be here, and Congress needs to get it done,” Biden said over the weekend.,"right"
A look at what Biden meant, and the political and policy considerations at play:,"right"
Biden wants continued funding for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s invasion.,"right"
As the talks have progressed, Biden has come to embrace efforts to reach a bipartisan border security deal after years of gridlock on overhauling the immigration system.,"right"
Biden is referencing an expulsion authority being negotiated by the lawmakers that would automatically kick in on days when illegal crossings reached more than 5,000 over a five-day average across the Southern border, which is currently seeing as many as 10,000 crossings per day.,"right"
The recent echoes of the former president by Biden, who had long argued that Trump's border policies were inhumane, reflect the growing public concern about illegal migration.,"right"
But Biden's stance threatens to alienate progressives who already believe he has shifted too far right on border policies.,"right"
Biden could, in theory, strongly limit asylum claims and restrict crossings, but the effort would be almost certainly be challenged in court and would be far more likely to be blocked or curtailed dramatically without a congressional law backing the new changes.,"right"
Trump is loath to give a win to Biden on an issue that animated the Republican’s successful 2016 campaign and that he wants to use as he seeks to return to the White House.,"right"
Biden's embrace of the congressional framework points to how the administration's efforts to enact a broader immigration overhaul have been stymied.,"right"
On his first day in office, Biden sent a comprehensive immigration proposal to Congress and signed more executive orders than Trump.,"right"
Biden's aides and allies see the asylum changes as part of the crackdown effort and that's in part why they have been receptive to the proposals.,"right"
This is the apocalyptic version of American life that President Donald Trump argues would be the dire consequence of turning over the White House to Democrat Joe Biden.,"right"
"He'll bury you in regulations, dismantle your police departments, dissolve our borders, confiscate your guns, terminate religious liberty, destroy your suburbs," Trump said in one of many over-the-top pronouncements about Biden in the campaign's final weeks.,"right"
"It's pure fear and fear based on a particular kind of ignorance that only works if your hearers have that particular kind of ignorance," Robin Lakoff, professor emerita of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, said of Trump's claims about Biden.,"right"
Now, he is giving voters a laundry list of mostly implausible reasons to fear a Biden presidency.,"right"
It's a choice between our plan to Kill the virus - or Biden's plan to kill the American dream!","right"
Trump has criticized Biden for saying he'd follow the scientists, and the president claims the Democrat would shut the country down.,"right"
In fact, Biden hasn't said whether he'd endorse large-scale shutdowns of the nation's economy, if things get drastically worse, like much of the country did in March.,"right"
"If you vote for Biden, it means no kids in school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas and no Fourth of July together," Trump said at a rally Wednesday in Goodyear, Arizona.,"right"
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said Trump's rhetoric is effective with people who are already disposed to believe such things about Biden.,"right"
Last week in Florida, Trump sought to boost his standing among older Americans angered by his response to the coronavirus by portraying Biden as the one who would do them harm.,"right"
Trump falsely said Biden's energy plan "would mean that America's seniors have no air conditioning during the summer, no heat during the winter and no electricity during peak hours.","right"
During a summer of unrest that followed the police killings of Black men, Trump sought to portray Biden as beholden to the "radical-left" forces Trump claimed were behind the protests.,"right"
He also argued that Biden wouldn't be able to keep such unrest from spreading to the suburbs.,"right"
David Zarefsky, who teaches courses about presidential rhetoric at Northwestern, said close examination shows the weakness in Trump's argument about Biden and the suburbs.,"right"
In July, Biden said Trump was the country's first racist president, which glossed over the presidents before Trump who had held slaves.,"right"
They've tried to get elected president," Biden said.,"right"
"Those who are making the argument about Trump are offering evidence from his rhetoric and actions," she said, adding that the attacks on Biden are "not justified by what he's said or done.","right"
BERLIN — U.S. President Joe Biden said it's important for Ukraine's Western allies to “sustain our resolve” in supporting the country as he held meetings Friday with European partners, with the upcoming U.S. presidential election casting a long shadow over his visit to Germany.,"right"
Biden met Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, Ukraine's second-biggest military supplier after the U.S., and was to be joined by French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer for discussions that also were to address the conflict in the Middle East.,"right"
With the election just weeks away and the race extremely tight, there are worries that a victory by Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, could upset the relationships that Biden is hoping to pass on to Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.,"right"
“As Ukraine faces a tough winter, we must — we must — sustain our resolve, our effort and our support,” Biden said.,"right"
Biden didn’t want his term to end without visiting Berlin, after having been to other key allies such as Japan, South Korea, France, India, the U.K., Poland and Ukraine.,"right"
The chancellor thanked Biden for the two leaders' “extraordinarily close” cooperation.,"right"
Concerns about what might come next were reflected as Biden received the highest class of Germany’s Order of Merit, which was also bestowed on former U.S. President George H.W. Bush for his support of German reunification.,"right"
He said Biden “restored Europe's hope in the trans-Atlantic alliance literally overnight.”,"right"
Recalling the “wide sweep of history” he has seen in his 81 years, Biden said, “we should never underestimate the power of democracy, never underestimate the value of alliances.”,"right"
As he met Scholz, Biden said he was “grateful for Germany’s cooperation in holding Iran accountable for destabilizing policies, including providing missiles and drones to Russia to use against Ukraine.” He pointed to new European sanctions against Iran's leading airlines and said that “this coordination is going to have to continue.”,"right"
Biden reiterated his call for Israel to pursue peace after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar — which he described as “a moment of justice.”,"right"
Harris, for her part, has voiced strong backing for Ukraine and tracks with Biden on support for Israel, while placing particular emphasis on the need to relieve the suffering of Palestinian civilians whose lives have been upended by the Hamas-Israel war.,"right"
WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice President Joe Biden is throwing his unequivocal support behind letting transgender people serve openly in the U.S. military, as the Obama administration considers whether and when to lift the longstanding ban.,"right"
Biden's declaration at the Human Rights Campaign's annual dinner Saturday goes further than anything the Obama administration has said before, evoking memories of when Biden outpaced President Barack Obama in endorsing gay marriage.,"right"
"No longer is there any question transgender people are able to serve in the United States military," Biden told a crowd of 3,000 gay rights activists at the group's star-studded gala.,"right"
Biden, who is considering running for president, declared transgender rights to be "the civil rights issue of our time" as he delivered the keynote speech, just hours after Hillary Rodham Clinton - his top rival if he enters the race - gave a rousing address elevating LGBT rights as a main pillar of 2016 bid.,"right"
Biden said gays and lesbians shouldn't fear "those shrill voices" trying to undo gay marriage and other advances because Americans "have moved so far beyond them and their appeals to prejudice and fear and homophobia.","right"
"There's homophobes still left - most of them are running for president," Biden said, in a playful yet cutting jab at the Republican candidates he could one day face.,"right"
Biden, in his speech, left no such wiggle room.,"right"
When an audience member interrupted with a loud shout of "you should run," Biden quickly shifted back to a story about his dad.,"right"
Biden won praise for endorsing gay marriage in 2012 ahead of Obama or Clinton, becoming the highest elected official to support the politically charged issue.,"right"
The group also asked Obama to speak, then invited Biden when Obama was unavailable.,"right"
Although Biden has enjoyed strong support from gay groups, many prominent gay Democrats have committed to Clinton, who drew loud cheers whenever her face appeared in videos played before Biden's speech.,"right"
Richard Socarides, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton, said gay activists have a strong emotional connection to Clinton despite Biden's "special footnote in the history of our battle for marriage.","right"
President Joe Biden faces comparable jeopardy, already trailing in the polls behind a presumptive Republican nominee who is patently unstable if not fundamentally impaired, four times criminally indicted and certifiably fraudulent — and that's just for starters.,"right"
Biden, a good man and a successful president, finds himself battered by extremists on either side of him: MAGA on the right and “From the River to the Sea” on the left.,"right"
DETROIT — Four years ago, candidate Joe Biden stood before supporters at a Detroit high school, flanked by Kamala Harris and other rising Democratic stars, and called himself a bridge to the next generation of leaders.,"right"
Biden, now a president seeking reelection, returns to that same high school Friday with many in his party now pleading for him to fulfill that very promise and step aside.,"right"
But Biden remains defiant that he'll remain in the race despite a disastrous debate performance that triggered a wave of calls for him to end his candidacy.,"right"
During a news conference Thursday, when asked why he no longer considered himself a “bridge” to the next generation of leaders, Biden responded that “what changed was the gravity of the situation I inherited in terms of the economy, foreign policy, and domestic division.","right"
“We've never been here before,” Biden continued.,"right"
In the two weeks since his debate debacle, Biden and his team have been on a relentless sprint to convince fretting lawmakers, nervous donors and a skeptical electorate that at the age of 81, he is still capable of being president.,"right"
But a spate of travel to battleground states, interviews with journalists and a rare solo news conference have done little to tamp down the angst within the party about Biden's candidacy and his prospects against Donald Trump in November.,"right"
So far, one Democratic senator and roughly 20 House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to step aside.,"right"
Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has indicated Biden still has a decision to make on whether to run, even though the president has made it clear he remains in the race.,"right"
House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries met privately with Biden after the press conference, sharing the “full breadth” of views from the House Democrats about the path forward in the president’s campaign for reelection, he said in a letter to colleagues.,"right"
Biden spent the hours before he left for Michigan meeting separately with Asian American and Latino lawmakers, although with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the president was told directly by California Rep.,"right"
Still, Biden advisers and aides, largely satisfied with the president's press conference performance Thursday at the conclusion of the NATO summit, are more forcefully urging the reticent factions of the party to move on from the Atlanta debate.,"right"
Michael Tyler, a spokesperson for Biden’s campaign, said donations “exploded” Thursday night during the president’s news conference, describing it as a sign that support for the president remains strong “across our coalition.”,"right"
“We have close to 40,000 donations last night alone,” Tyler told reporters traveling to Detroit with Biden.,"right"
Jim Clyburn, one of the president's most influential allies, said in an NBC interview Friday morning that chatter about whether Biden should stay in the race needs to stop.,"right"
“The conversation should focus on the record of this administration, on the alternative to his election, and let Joe Biden continue to make his own decisions about his future,” Clyburn said.,"right"
Biden's campaign has indirectly acknowledged that Biden's route to the White House is narrowing, saying the so-called “blue wall” of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania is now the “clearest pathway” to victory even while insisting other battleground states like Arizona and Nevada are not out of reach.,"right"
That strategy is reflected in how Biden is redoubling his efforts in the Midwestern states, hitting Detroit nearly one week after he campaigned in Madison, Wisconsin; Philadelphia; and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.,"right"
Rallying enthusiasm in Detroit and among its sizable Black population could prove decisive for Biden’s chances of winning Michigan, which Biden reclaimed in 2020 after Donald Trump won it in four years prior by just over 10,000 votes.,"right"
But at a critical juncture when Biden needs to consolidate support, key Democratic leaders in the state will notably be absent at Friday's event, where Biden plans to speak about the “Project 2025” agenda, a massive proposed overhaul of the federal government drafted by longtime allies and former officials in the Trump administration.,"right"
Gretchen Whitmer, who is co-chair of Biden’s campaign, will be out of the state.,"right"
Gary Peters, a steadfast supporter of Biden, and Rep.,"right"
United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, whom Biden actively courted during last year’s strikes and who met with him and other union leaders Wednesday, is traveling for a conference.,"right"
Hillary Scholten, who is seeking reelection in a battleground district in western Michigan, joined a growing list of national Democrats who have called on Biden to step aside.,"right"
But in a swing state that he won by close to 3 percentage points in 2020, Biden continues to command support.,"right"
Shri Thanedar and AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler accompanied Biden on Air Force One from Washington to Detroit, in Biden's fourth trip to the state this year.,"right"
And over a dozen Detroit-area state lawmakers signed onto a joint letter Thursday “to express our unwavering support" for Biden.,"right"
In his return to Michigan, Biden aims to reignite the energy felt in March 2020 when appearing at Detroit's Renaissance High School.,"right"
During that appearance, Biden had locked hands with Harris, Whitmer and New Jersey Sen.,"right"
“I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,” Biden said.,"right"
Biden reclaimed much of that support four years ago, when he defeated Trump in Michigan by a 154,000-vote margin, but he has work to do.,"right"
Key parts of Biden’s coalition in Michigan are also upset with him over Israel’s offensive following Hamas’ Oct.,"right"
Presiden> Joe Biden promised jobs and better access to education in an appeal that may resonate with suburban swing voters during a historic trip to McHenry County College.,"right"
"America is back," Biden said Wednesday, promising to fund transportation through an infrastructure package that faces opposition in Congress.,"right"
"Think how life will be when it's quicker to drive on Randall Road," Biden quipped, singling out a local traffic hot spot.,"right"
And, outside the college, along Route 14 in Crystal Lake, a large crowd of Trump supporters gathered with flags and banners to rail against Biden.,"right"
"I think everything they're (Biden administration) doing is harmful to our nation right now," Crystal Lake resident Fred Bock told the Northwest Herald.,"right"
But inside, Biden thanked college President Clint Gabbard for delaying a vacation to host him, and jokingly called himself "Jill Biden's husband," noting his wife is a community college professor.,"right"
In 1972, Biden became a single father caring for two sons after his wife and daughter died in a car crash.,"right"
"Illinois farmers are dealing with more frequent droughts, and just south of here we had an unprecedented tornado," Biden said referring to the twister that hit the Naperville area June 20.,"right"
Biden was introduced by Edith Sanchez, student trustee on the MCC board of trustees.,"right"
"We are very big supporters of Biden," Sarah Fisher said before the president's arrival.,"right"
When they learned Biden was coming to the suburbs, "we thought what a historical, momentous opportunity for our kids to see democracy in action.","right"
McHenry Board Chairman Michael Buehler, a Republican, said it was "exciting" that Biden picked the county.,"right"
Biden garnered 47.7% of the vote in McHenry County and Trump received 50.2% in 2020.,"right"
One reason for Biden's visit is the perceived boost for local congressmen facing challenges in the midterms, including Democratic U.S. Rep.,"right"
Biden recognized Underwood during his remarks, as well as Gov.,"right"
"That's good for families and is good for the economy and it will create more jobs," said Biden, who repeated the word "jobs" several times during his speech.,"right"
Biden noted one in every 10 Illinoisans lack access to broadband, and that resonated with Buehler.,"right"
Biden said he would pay for the infrastructure plan through closing corporate income tax loopholes.,"right"
But Biden's proposals "all come at a cost," said DeWitte, who was not at the speech.,"right"

A look at former Vice President Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign and his time serving with President Barack Obama.,"right"
That is, Harris has to convince voters she can do better than her boss, Joe Biden, has done.,"right"
That's a tall order for a vice president who has been as unavailable in 2024 as Biden was during the 2020 campaign.,"right"
At least Biden had COVID as an excuse for working from his basement.,"right"
Considering how low-energy Biden has been in his term of office, Harris had to make sure that she didn't look as if she was trying to elbow the old man off the path.,"right"
Then came the Biden-Trump debate.,"right"
Followed by Biden's announcement that he would not run for reelection.,"right"
Second, Harris is not Biden — or is she?,"right"
EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. — President Joe Biden is looking to recapture his mojo and reassure donors at a Saturday fundraiser that he is fully up to the challenge of beating Donald Trump.,"right"
Biden's meandering answers and struggles to respond to Trump prompted The New York Times editorial board to declare Friday that he should exit the race and that staying in would be a “reckless gamble.”,"right"
Biden and his wife, Jill, attended an afternoon campaign event in East Hampton, New York, the Long Island beach town where the real estate firm Zillow prices the median home at $1.9 million.,"right"
Addressing the gathering, Biden quickly tore into Trump over his presidential record including his treatment of veterans and said of Thursday night's debate, “I didn’t have a great night, but neither did Trump.”,"right"
Biden contended that the polling he’s seen shows that Democrats moved up after the debate, saying of Trump: “The big take-away was his lies.”,"right"
In the aftermath of Thursday night's debate, Biden flashed more vigor in speeches in North Carolina and New York on Friday, saying he believes with “all my heart and soul” that he can do the job of the presidency.,"right"
The Biden campaign said it has raised more than $27 million on Thursday and Friday, including $3 million at a New York City fundraiser focused on the LGBTQ+ community.,"right"
Jill Biden told supporters Friday that he said to her after the debate, “You know, Jill, I don’t know what happened.,"right"
Democratic donors across New York, Southern California and Silicon Valley privately expressed deep concerns about the viability of Biden’s campaign in the wake of his debate performance.,"right"
But on Friday, there was no formal push to pressure Biden to step aside and some suspected there never would be given the logistical challenges associated with replacing the presumptive nominee just four months before Election Day.,"right"
They said receipts from Biden’s weekend fundraiser would almost certainly be strong because the tickets were sold and paid for before the debate.,"right"
Education agencies and individuals in Illinois on Wednesday began assessing what President Joe Biden's newly announced plan for student loan debt forgiveness means on a personal level and on a broader scale.,"right"
So, she said, "the Biden-Harris Student Debt Relief Plan could have a significant impact on borrowers across Illinois.","right"
Biden's plan would forgive up to $10,000 in student loan debt for individuals earning less than $125,000 per year or families earning less than $250,000 annually.,"right"
Griffin said thousands of educators across the state will see much-needed debt relief with Biden's decision.,"right"
PHILADELPHIA (AP) - President Joe Biden charged in a prime-time address that the 'œextreme ideology'ť of Donald Trump and his adherents 'œthreatens the very foundation of our republic,'ť as he summoned Americans of all stripes to help counter what he sketched as dark forces within the Republican Party trying to subvert democracy.,"right"
In his speech Thursday night at Philadelphia's Independence Hall, Biden unleashed the trappings of the presidency in an unusually strong and sweeping indictment of Trump and what he said has become the dominant strain of the opposition party.,"right"
His broadside came barely two months before Americans head to the polls in bitterly contested midterm elections that Biden calls a crossroads for the nation.,"right"
The explicit effort by Biden to marginalize Trump and his followers marks a sharp recent turn for the president, who preached his desire to bring about national unity in his inaugural address.,"right"
Asked on Friday if he considered all Trump supporters a threat to the country, Biden said, 'œI don't consider any Trump supporter a threat to the country.'ť,"right"
Biden, who largely avoided even referring to 'œthe former guy'ť by name during his first year in office, has grown increasingly vocal in calling out Trump personally.,"right"
Wading into risky political terrain, Biden strained to balance his criticism with an appeal to more traditional Republicans to make their voices heard.,"right"
Delivering a preemptive rebuttal from Scranton, Pennsylvania, where Biden was born, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said it is the Democratic president, not Republicans, trying to divide Americans.,"right"
'œIn the past two years, Joe Biden has launched an assault on the soul of America, on its people, on its laws, on its most sacred values,'ť McCarthy said.,"right"
White House officials said the sharp tenor of Biden's remarks reflected his mounting concern about Trump allies' ideological proposals and relentless denial of the nation's 2020 election results.,"right"
'œEquality and democracy are under assault'ť in the U.S., Biden charged, casting Trump and his backers in the GOP as a menace to the nation's system of government, its standing abroad and its citizens' way of life.,"right"
Biden's appearance was promoted as an official, taxpayer-funded event, a mark of how the president views defeating the Trump agenda as a policy aim as much as a political one.,"right"
Biden harked back to the 2017 white supremacist protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, which he said brought him out of political retirement to challenge Trump.,"right"
Biden argued that the country faces a similar crossroads in the coming months, and he cast defending the 'œsoul of the nation'ť as 'œthe work of my presidency - a mission I believe in with my whole soul.'ť,"right"
But Iowa GOP chair Jeff Kaufman said in a statement that Biden was using the tactics of an authoritarian regime, 'œtrying to turn his political opponents into an enemy of the state.'ť,"right"
The White House has tried to keep Biden removed from the legal and political maelstrom surrounding the Department of Justice's discovery of classified documents in Trump's Florida home.,"right"
Still, Biden has pointed to some Republicans' quick condemnation of federal law enforcement, to argue 'œyou can't be pro-insurrectionist and pro-American.'ť,"right"
The White House intended the speech to unite familiar themes: holding out bipartisan legislative wins on guns and infrastructure as evidence that democracies 'œcan deliver,'ť pushing back on GOP policies on guns and abortion that Biden says are out of step with most people's views.,"right"
Yet Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research polling has shown about two-thirds of Republicans say they do not think Biden was legitimately elected president.,"right"
KYIV, Ukraine — The Biden administration is determined in its final months to help ensure that Ukraine can keep fighting off Russia's full-scale invasion next year, sending it as much aid as possible so that it might hold Russian forces at bay and possess a strong hand in any potential peace negotiations, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday.,"right"
“President Biden has committed to making sure that every dollar we have at our disposal will be pushed out the door between now and Jan.,"right"
PITTSBURGH — Vice President Kamala Harris used a joint campaign appearance with President Joe Biden in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania on Monday to say that U.S. Steel should remain domestically owned — concurring with the White House's monthslong opposition to the company's planned sale to Japan's Nippon Steel.,"right"
That echoes Biden, who repeated Monday what he's said since March — that he opposes U.S. Steel's would-be sale to Nippon, believing it would hurt the country's steelworkers.,"right"
It's little surprise that Harris would agree with Biden on the issue, but it nonetheless constitutes a major policy position for the vice president, who has offered relatively few of them since Biden abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed his vice president in July.,"right"
Biden took the stage first and was met with chants of “Thank You, Joe” as he and Harris appeared in an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers hall.,"right"
Biden also started to say, “Kamala Harris and I are going to build on this” as if he were still running and she was his running mate — but he corrected himself.,"right"
It underscored just how much the race has changed and how Harris has been careful to balance presenting herself as “a new way forward” while remaining intensely loyal to Biden and the policies he has pushed.,"right"
Her delivery is very different — and in some cases she's pushed to move faster than Biden's administration — but the overall goal of expanding government programs to buoy the middle class is the same.,"right"
The joint rally with Biden was Harris' second of the day and followed Pittsburgh's Labor Day parade, one of the country's largest.,"right"
The 81-year-old Biden has spent most of his lengthy political career forging close ties with organized labor.,"right"
In addition to opposing the Nippon Steel sale, Biden has endorsed expanding tariffs on imported Chinese steel — another area of policy agreement with Trump, who has cheered steeper foreign tariffs on many imports.,"right"
The 59-year-old Harris has sought to appeal to voters by positioning herself as a break from former president Trump's acerbic rhetoric while also looking to move beyond the Biden era.,"right"
Harris events feel very different from Biden's, which usually featured small crowds.,"right"
She's moved faster than Biden in some cases, calling for using tax cuts and incentives to encourage homeownership and ending federal taxes on tips for service industry employees.,"right"
But she's also offered relatively few specifics on major policies, instead continuing to side with Biden on top issues.,"right"
Harris appeared onstage with Biden after the president addressed the opening night of last month's Democratic National Convention, but they had not shared a microphone at a political event since Biden himself was running against Trump.,"right"
For more than 3 1/2 years, Harris has been one of Biden's chief validators.,"right"
Now the tables are turned, as Harris looks to lean on Biden — a native of Scranton, Pennsylvania — to help win the potentially decisive state.,"right"
Although the vice president has appeared more forceful in speaking about the plight of civilians in Gaza, as Israel's war against Hamas there nears the 11-month mark, she also has endorsed Biden's efforts to arm Israel and bring about a hostage deal and cease-fire.,"right"
Before she left Washington for Detroit, Biden and Harris met in the White House Situation Room earlier Monday with the U.S. hostage deal negotiating team.,"right"
“History will show what we here know: Joe Biden has been one of the most transformative presidents,” Harris said in Pittsburgh.,"right"
When that event was over, Biden and Harris rode back to the airport together in the presidential limo.,"right"
A smattering of protests broke out around the country Saturday after former Vice President Joe Biden won the presidency, with President Donald Trump and his supporters refusing to accept defeat and pushing unfounded suspicions that rampant voter fraud was denying him a second term.,"right"
Georgia, which hasn't gone for a Democrat since 1992, was on the cusp of swinging into Biden's corner.,"right"
While a key battleground state, Biden was pushed over into the win column with projected results from Pennsylvania and Nevada to secure enough electoral votes to become the nation's 46th president.,"right"
'œThere's election fraud going on here,'ť said Kelley, voicing the belief that voters in Georgia, a state led by a Republican governor and with a Republican secretary of state, had been improperly counted to put Biden ahead.,"right"
Shortly after Biden was projected to win the presidential race, some 75 Trump protesters gathered Saturday morning outside the election tabulation center in downtown Phoenix.,"right"
Elections officials in several states where Biden led said the anger outside their doors made them fear for the safety of their employees.,"right"
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden used his highly anticipated news conference Thursday to deliver a forceful defense of his foreign and domestic policies, and batted away questions about his ability to serve another four years even as he flubbed a reference to Donald Trump in one of his first answers.,"right"
I’m in this to complete the job I started,” Biden said as he insisted his support among the electorate was strong and he would stay in the race and would win.,"right"
Top donors, supporters and key lawmakers are doubtful of Biden’s abilities to carry on his reelection bid after his disastrous June 27 debate performance, but the hard-fighting 81-year-old president refuses to give up as he prepares to take on Trump in a rematch.,"right"
The first questioner of Biden’s press conference asked about him losing support among many of his fellow Democrats and unionists, and asked about Vice President Kamala Harris.,"right"
Biden was at first defiant, saying the “UAW endorsed me, but go ahead,” meaning the United Auto Workers.,"right"
Trump weighed in live on Biden’s news conference with a post on his social media network of a video clip of the president saying “Vice President Trump.”,"right"
Most of the hourlong press conference was vintage Biden: He gave long answers on foreign policy and told well-worn anecdotes.,"right"
I believe I'm the best qualitied to win," Biden said, adding that he will stay in the race until his staff says, “There’s no way you can win.”,"right"
Earlier, Biden's campaign laid out what it sees as its path to keeping the White House in a new memo, saying that winning the “blue wall” states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan is the “clearest pathway” to victory.,"right"
The people said the polling was not necessarily to show that she could be the nominee in Biden’s place, but rather to better understand how she’s viewed.,"right"
While Biden has expressed confidence in his chances, his campaign on Thursday acknowledged he is behind, and a growing number of the president’s aides in the White House and the campaign privately harbor doubts that he can turn things around.,"right"
But they’re taking their cues from Biden, expressing that he is in 100% unless and until he isn’t, and there appears to be no organized internal effort to persuade the president to step aside.,"right"
But in announcing a compact that would bring together NATO countries to support Ukraine, Biden referred to the nation’s leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy as “President Putin” to audible gasps in the room.,"right"
President Zelenskyy,” Biden said.,"right"
“You’re a hell of a lot better,” Biden said back.,"right"
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer invited Biden’s team to meet with senators privately at the lunch hour to discuss concerns and the path forward, but some senators groused they would prefer to hear from the president himself.,"right"
In the Senate, only Peter Welch of Vermont has so far called for Biden to step out of the race.,"right"
The 90-minute conversation with the president's team, which one person said included no new data, polling or game plan on how Biden would beat Trump, did not appear to change senators' minds.,"right"
The meeting was frank, angry at times and also somewhat painful, since many in the room know and love Biden, said one senator who requested anonymity to discuss the private briefing.,"right"
Senators confronted the advisers over Biden’s performance at the debate and the effect on Senate races this year,"right"
At the same time, influential senators are standing strongly with Biden, leaving the party at an impasse.,"right"
Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, told the AP he thinks Biden "is going to win this election.,"right"
Sanders said he has been publicly critical of the campaign, and said Biden needs to talk more about the future and his plans for the country.,"right"
No matter the result of next month's election, President Joe Biden will soon leave the White House.,"right"
That's $2 trillion more than last year and $6 trillion more than when the Biden-Harris team entered the White House.,"right"
Now, the Biden-Harris administration isn't the only one responsible for this debt spiral.,"right"
But when Biden and Harris took office, most of the pandemic was behind us.,"right"
Biden had other plans.,"right"
Instead of suggesting, like then-President Barack Obama did after the Great Recession, that he would halve the deficit in five years, Biden decided it was time to extend pandemic emergency programs.,"right"
Three months into the term and four months after the last $900 billion COVID-19 relief bill, the Biden-Harris administration pushed through another $1.9 trillion bill.,"right"
This condition certainly doesn't apply to the Biden-Harris spending spree.,"right"
When Biden and Harris entered the White House, the budget deficit was a pandemic-influenced $2.3 trillion, and it was set to fall to $905 billion by 2024.,"right"
Even this is nothing compared to what Biden and Harris hoped to spend.,"right"
A little more than a week after canceling a trip to the suburbs, President Joe Biden's planned visit to Elk Grove Village is back on Thursday, when he's expected to push his COVID-19 vaccination mandates for businesses, seek support for two spending bills, and raise some campaign cash along the way.,"right"
Brad Schneider and Sean Casten on Wednesday confirmed news of Biden's rescheduled appearance.,"right"
The three local politicians will be among the invited guests at Biden's visit to the Elk Grove Technology Park, where a $123 million Microsoft data center campus is under construction.,"right"
Officials say Biden is expected to speak sometime after noon, ahead of a Democratic National Committee lunch and fundraiser at a local restaurant.,"right"
Johnson said the village staff is working with White House officials to make sure Biden's visit is "as easy, safe and friendly as can be.","right"
Biden canceled his originally scheduled Sept.,"right"
Johnson watched Biden's speech Tuesday, when the president was at a union training center in Howell, Michigan, to tout the federal infrastructure bill.,"right"
The mayor said Elk Grove's $1 billion, 85-acre tech park fits within the message of Biden's agenda of building up manufacturing, clean energy and jobs.,"right"
In the official presidential travel advisory, White House officials said Biden is coming to the Chicago area "to highlight the importance of COVID-19 vaccine requirements.","right"
It's believed the Elk Grove construction site was chosen because the Microsoft buildings are being built by Clayco, a commercial real estate development, engineering, architecture and construction firm that has supported Biden's vaccine mandate plan for employers with more than 100 workers.,"right"
In line with the proposed Biden mandate, the company is requiring its employees to get vaccinated or tested weekly.,"right"
The firm, which has offices in Chicago, is headed by Bob Clark, a major Democratic donor who has helped raise funds for Biden and former President Barack Obama.,"right"
Biden on Sept.,"right"
Biden visited the shop when he was vice president in 2009 - and he'll only be miles away on Thursday - but co-owner Meg Capannari said there weren't any plans in the works for a visit or delivery this time.,"right"
Nevermind: Biden's planned visit to Elk Grove Village Wednesday is canceled,"right"
The Week That Was: Biden was coming, then he wasn't; Elgin driver shot on tollway,"right"
Let's try this again: Biden set to visit Chicago area Thursday,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden has a fresh opportunity Thursday to try to prove to the American public that he’s capable of serving another four years after his shocking debate flop threw the future of his presidency into doubt.,"right"
But Biden is not known as a master of the big rhetorical moment and his recent cleanup efforts have proved inadequate.,"right"
Biden, 81, will close out the NATO summit in Washington — an event meant to showcase his leadership on the world stage — with a rare solo press conference.,"right"
By many metrics, from job growth and major legislation to the expanded trans-Atlantic alliance, Biden can point to successes during his tenure in office.,"right"
Biden has tried to step up his performance since the debate but his follow-up interview on ABC last week was disappointing.,"right"
Americans tend to regard their leaders less for what they do than how they make them feel, and Biden's debate disaster has shaken his party to its core.,"right"
“Voters may see Biden’s frailty as a symbol of weakness or its own kind of instability.”,"right"
Biden can give a good speech — his State of the Union address earlier this year helped quiet doubters about his viability as a candidate.,"right"
Yet those moments, in private or before small crowds, even if amplified on social media as Biden's team hopes, are certain to reach fewer people than the tens of millions who watched his bout with Trump.,"right"
Despite a drumbeat of calls from some in his party to step aside, Biden has dug in, insisting he's the best Democrat to defeat Trump, whose candidacy he's called an existential threat to democracy.,"right"
Even before the debate, Biden's victories as president have often come despite his inability to sell them to a skeptical public.,"right"
The debate, rather than helping Biden reset the race against Trump, confirmed voters' preestablished fears about him, said Allison Prasch, a professor of rhetoric who researches presidential communications at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.,"right"
Biden aides and allies responded to the debate with a series of public pronouncements defending Biden’s mental state and fitness for the job, notably focused on the big decisions of the Oval Office, rather than his ability to articulate them to the masses.,"right"
Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa and a veteran of four administrations, said he has never been concerned about Biden’s decision-making.,"right"
Speaking of Biden, he told The Associated Press: “I have never seen a president who is not prepared, who is not deliberate, who is not asking rigorous questions of those in the room or of a foreign leader,” adding that Biden “makes decisions sometimes which are often difficult decisions, and then actually follows up.”,"right"
While Biden and his team have made a concerted effort since the debate to increase his public visibility — which had been limited by aides worried about Biden's penchant for gaffes or missteps — he has proven to be uneven and at times underwhelming.,"right"
Campaigning in Pennsylvania on Sunday, Biden delivered remarks for less than 10 minutes at a Philadelphia church and a Harrisburg rally, but spent three times as long taking selfies and hugging kids — the sort of feel-good content that has always bolstered his political fortunes.,"right"
A call-in interview with MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” showcased Biden's defiance and distaste of party “elites” as he pledged to stay in the race.,"right"
In his opening remarks at the NATO summit, Biden was forceful in defense of the alliance.,"right"
“The more he gets out there to campaign with voters, the starker the contrast and easier the choice will be for these voters: between Joe Biden, a decent man fighting for the middle class and an unhinged billionaire like Trump who wants to terminate the ACA and turn our country into a dictatorship,” said campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz, referring in part to the Affordable Care Act.,"right"
Suburban Democratic leaders remain mum about the details of President Joe Biden's planned visit Wednesday to McHenry County College in Crystal Lake.,"right"
"The event is not a political event," Kristina Zahorik, chair of the Democratic Party of McHenry County, said in a written statement about Biden's visit.,"right"
J.B. Pritzker's press secretary, confirmed Monday the governor will join Biden during his visit, though she could not share details.,"right"
Stevenson High School alumnus Matt Hill, Biden's senior associate communications director, first announced the president's upcoming visit to Crystal Lake in a tweet Saturday evening.,"right"
The White House officially has not announced the location of the visit or what topics Biden will discuss.,"right"
McHenry County College spokeswoman Christina Haggerty could not confirm Monday whether Biden will be making a stop there.,"right"
Biden has been touring Midwestern states in the past week to get public support for his bipartisan, $973 billion infrastructure package and policies geared toward families and education, The Associated Press reported.,"right"
It's the only collar county that didn't vote for Biden.,"right"
Lauren Underwood, who represents the 14th Congressional District, hinted in a recent interview with WGN Channel 9 that Biden's visit would be "special.","right"
And so, Joe Biden is now a joke about adult diapers because he is not a fictional character (and Donald Trump is) and he's gotten old.,"right"
Seen in the vanishing light of honor, Biden stood under an artillery barrage of lies during the first debate.,"right"
Biden, whose pre-presidential political career deserved a B- grade, may have lost his speed, but he's held on to the notion of his honor.,"right"
And Biden is right.,"right"
Joe Biden, older and weaker than he used to be, knows what he must force his aging body and mind to do, and that is stand against what many of us see as the descent of this nation into a putrid soup of hatred, a time when the country will be given outright to bloated corporations who work you long hours for bad wages and no insurance and no union, and then tell you it can be fixed with the Ten Commandments and more blind hatred of anyone poorer than you are.,"right"
Watch Joe Biden.,"right"
Biden stands in honor and offers himself as his nation's shield.,"right"
After Joe Biden tripped up his boss by voicing support for same-sex marriage while the president remained on the fence, speculation was rampant about whether the remarks were spontaneous or deliberate.,"right"
But to those who know Biden, there was no doubt.,"right"
“That's what you get,” said John Marttila, a political strategist who worked alongside Biden in his first Senate campaign, and many others since.,"right"
Biden long has cast himself as a regular guy, who still relishes wading into a crowd or taking a microphone, searching for a way to connect with middle-class voters who remind him of his own Scranton, Pa. roots.,"right"
But this is also the Joe Biden who is known for strong opinions grounded in experience and study, as well as the self-regard that makes him a wild card.,"right"
Biden took on the vice presidency after a 36-year Senate career he hoped would lead to the Oval Office.,"right"
It has not always gone smoothly, largely because of Biden's well-known tendency to speak out loud and at length.,"right"
Before Joe went into that situation, he had to resolve that in himself,” said his sister, Valerie Biden Owens, a political confidant since she managed his first campaign for a county seat in Delaware.,"right"
Biden has emerged as a very different vice president from predecessor Dick Cheney.,"right"
To understand Biden as vice president, though, requires knowing the journey that shaped him and brought him to this point.,"right"
In the Biden house, every Sunday started with Catholic Mass and ended with family, the younger ones listening in as the older men hashed out politics around the kitchen table.,"right"
Biden's stories,"right"
As the administration's frequent ambassador to white, working-class voters, Biden has waxed so often about growing up in 1950s Scranton, the stories have taken on the gloss of fable.,"right"
In fact, Biden, who turns 70 in November, grew up in a solid, middle-class neighborhood.,"right"
Even so, his parent's decision to move in with his grandfather when Biden was 5 was a step backward.,"right"
Biden's father had done well as a manager for a company servicing merchant marine ships.,"right"
Biden's father found work cleaning boilers and selling pennants, before eventually managing a car dealership.,"right"
“My dad, Joseph Robinette Biden Sr., was a man of few words.,"right"
What I learned from him, I learned from watching,” Biden wrote in his 2007 autobiography.,"right"
Biden and his friends spent their days in Catholic school, returning home to waiting mothers before heading out into the neighborhood's ball fields and woods.,"right"
The Biden household was a gathering point, welcoming various uncles and the friends of Biden's grandfather.,"right"
When Joe Biden's family moved again to the suburbs of Wilmington, Del., the family drove back nearly every weekend.,"right"
“I remember distinctly as not having any feeling like he left,” says a Biden childhood friend, Tom Bell, now an insurance agent in the Scranton area.,"right"
Biden's family and friends recall him as a leader.,"right"
Bell recounts that after a neighborhood bully picked a fight, friend Charlie Roth called Biden, then 12 or 13 and living near Wilmington.,"right"
When the Bidens returned the following weekend, Joe beat up the bully on their behalf, Bell says.,"right"
Joe Biden went on to the University of Delaware.,"right"
The couple married and moved to Wilmington, where Biden accepted a job as a corporate lawyer.,"right"
His boss took him along to Democratic political meetings and Biden was invited to run for a county council seat, representing a majority Republican district.,"right"
Biden didn't even know where the council met, but he ran and won in 1970.,"right"
On a summer morning in 1971, the 28-year-old Biden was shaving in a Delaware motel room when he heard a knock on the door.,"right"
Biden, standing in his underwear with shaving cream cupped in his hand, worried he'd gotten himself into some sort of trouble.,"right"
Biden's first thought: Was he even old enough under the Constitution to take the oath of office?,"right"
Early polls showed Biden running far behind.,"right"
“I've been following politics for 40 years and there's never been a race in 40 years that was as much of a longshot as this,” said Ted Kaufman, a volunteer in that campaign who became Biden's long-time chief of staff before being appointed to serve out his final Senate term.,"right"
Biden's shoestring campaign, headed by sister Valerie, cranked out weekly brochures on newsprint delivered by volunteers to nearly every Delaware home.,"right"
Biden campaigned alongside his wife, sometimes with their three young children in tow.,"right"
Pitted against a popular incumbent, Biden took to opening his suit jacket to reveal a button on the inside of the lapel that said “I like Cale,” putting voters at ease, said Ron Williams, who covered the race as a reporter for the Wilmington News-Journal.,"right"
Biden won by a little more than 3,000 votes.,"right"
“When she hung up the phone, she looked white,” Biden wrote.,"right"
Neilia Biden was dead, killed in a car accident along with the couple's year-old daughter, Naomi.,"right"
Biden's two sons were critically injured.,"right"
In a speech this past May to families of U.S. soldiers killed in action, Biden recalled how the tragedy plunged him into anger and depression.,"right"
Biden's sister moved in to care for her nephews.,"right"
Biden told family and friends he would take a pass on the Senate.,"right"
But Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and others pleaded with Biden to give the job six months, with colleagues urging him to immerse himself in his work.,"right"
Kaufman recalls days when Biden seemed fine, and then the next “it'd be every bit as bad as the first day.,"right"
Biden found a comfort zone in Washington by maintaining one outside it, taking Amtrak home to Wilmington each night to be with his sons.,"right"
But Biden proposed six times before she agreed.,"right"
By 1980, Biden had built a reputation in the Senate as a comer, with some people encouraging him to think about a future run for the presidency, though he was not yet 40.,"right"
In his book, Biden writes that he resisted because he could not yet answer a question posed by Marttila about why he wanted to be president.,"right"
With Ronald Reagan nearing the end of his second term, Biden decided the time might be right.,"right"
The nation's attention turned to the Senate Judiciary Committee and its chairman, Biden.,"right"
By late summer, Biden was dividing his time and energy between stumping for the presidency and preparing to lead hearings on Bork, whose nomination drew heated opposition from liberals.,"right"
The two sides of Biden's political life collided as the hearings began, with newspaper reports that, during an Iowa debate, he had plagiarized a speech by British politician Neil Kinnock.,"right"
Then came allegations that, while at Syracuse, Biden had inserted large parts of a law review article, without attribution, into a paper he wrote.,"right"
Biden admitted making mistakes, but insisted it would have no effect on his candidacy.,"right"
They urged Biden to stay on.,"right"
Biden has said he viewed the Bork hearings as the beginning of a vindication.,"right"
While Biden writes about the Bork hearings at length in his book, he never mentions the Thomas confirmation.,"right"
During Biden's short-lived pursuit of the presidency, Marttila recalls, he'd been concerned when a staffer mentioned Biden was popping 10 Tylenols at a time.,"right"
In early 1988, though, Biden collapsed in a Rochester, N.Y., hotel room after a speech.,"right"
His survival and recovery left Biden feeling that he'd won a second chance, sharpening his sense of priorities.,"right"
But, as Biden did with the Balkans, he accompanied his rhetoric on Iraq with engagement, drawing up a proposal for a “soft partition” of the country into three ethno-religious regions and meeting with Iraqi leaders and military commanders.,"right"
When Biden traveled to Iraq as vice president late last year before the U.S. pullout, it was his 16th trip to the country.,"right"
In a 2008 primary season dominated by Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, Biden got little traction among voters or political donors and dropped out after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses.,"right"
Instead, when Obama became the nominee and asked Biden to join the ticket, the Delaware veteran agreed on one condition.,"right"
“I said I want a commitment from you that in every important decision you'll make, every critical decision, economic and political as well as foreign policy, I'll get to be in the room,” Biden said in a late 2008 television interview.,"right"
Obama turned to Biden early, asking him to oversee administration of the $787 billion in economic stimulus money approved by Congress.,"right"
Though Obama came to Washington opposing the Iraq war Biden initially supported, the vice president's deep knowledge of the country made him a natural point-man in the administration's dealings with Iraqi leaders, as well as defender against critics of the U.S. withdrawal.,"right"
Still, the agreement left important questions unsettled, with “a lot of uncertainty” about how Obama intended to use his vice president, Biden's former chief of staff, Ron Klain, said in an interview with The Associated Press in late 2010.,"right"
While Obama asked for Biden's opinion, he made key decisions that were at odds with that advice.,"right"
Biden, for example, advised that the country's financial condition was too shaky to pursue health care reform, but Obama moved ahead.,"right"
Yet when Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in March 2010, Biden was emphatic in recognizing the achievement and offering congratulations.,"right"
Biden also was the administration's most strident opponent of proposals to sharply increase the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.,"right"
Obama wound up dispatching 30,000 additional soldiers, but his decision to do so quickly and to set an end-date for most U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan has widely been seen as evidence of Biden's influence.,"right"
Biden “played a very important counter-role to the generals,” said Jules Witcover, a veteran political journalist who wrote a 2010 biography of Biden.,"right"
“Although you could say Biden lost that fight,” because the additional troops were deployed, “in the long run he has prevailed, or is in the process of prevailing, with the combat troops coming out of Iraq and the movement toward getting out of Afghanistan,” Witcover said.,"right"
Biden also has shown a willingness to give his boss credit, even when his advice has been rejected, mostly notably after he urged Obama not to go ahead with the U.S. military raid that killed Osama bin Laden.,"right"
The relationship between Obama and Biden has worked, say those who know them, because Obama is comfortable hearing the vice president's counsel, but also because of Biden's embrace of his role as adviser rather than top decision-maker.,"right"
“The secret is Obama's stood by the deal and Biden's stood by the deal.”,"right"
Now it's Joe Biden's turn: With a reelection campaign underway, there are signs that those behind the president are starting to more aggressively and publicly challenge how he is portrayed.,"right"
Within the past two weeks, an administration aide sent an unusual letter to the White House Correspondents' Association complaining about coverage of a special counsel's report on Biden's handling of classified documents.,"right"
In addition, the president's campaign objected to its perception that negative stories about Biden's age got more attention than remarks by Donald Trump about the NATO alliance.,"right"
Sams pointed to stories by CBS News, The Wall Street Journal, The Associated Press and others emphasizing that Hur had found evidence that Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified material.,"right"
It was Sams' second foray into press criticism in a few months; last fall he urged journalists to give more scrutiny to House Republicans and the reasons behind their impeachment inquiry of Biden.,"right"
In a separate statement, Biden campaign spokesman T.J. Ducklo criticized media outlets for time spent discussing the 81-year-old president's age and mental capacity, an issue that was raised anew when Biden addressed the Hur report with reporters.,"right"
To be fair, Trump's comments at a rally Friday night likely came past the deadlines of some sections where Biden stories appeared that weekend.,"right"
A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of The Times, noted in an interview with the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism that Biden's team had been “extremely upset” about its coverage lately.,"right"
The criticism comes amid the backdrop of unhappiness among some journalists about how much Biden is made available for questions — an issue that surfaced again when Biden turned down an opportunity to appear before tens of millions of Americans in an interview during the Super Bowl pregame show.,"right"
The 33 news conferences Biden has given during the first three years of his presidency is lower than any other American president in that time span since Ronald Reagan, said Martha Kumar, a Towson University professor emeritus and expert on presidents and the press.,"right"
Similarly, the 86 interviews Biden has given is lower than any president since she began studying records with Reagan.,"right"
Instead, Biden prefers more informal appearances where reporters ask a few questions, with comparatively little opportunity for follow-up, she said: The 535 such sessions that Biden conducted was second only to Trump's 572.,"right"
One example followed Biden's remarks Friday after the death of Russian dissident Aleksey Navalny.,"right"
Another was Biden's early evening availability following the release of Hur's report, a chaotic scene where reporters tried to outshout one another.,"right"
Some on Biden's team, meanwhile, believe the president showed a combativeness in the face of criticism that Americans will appreciate.,"right"
Sesno said he can understand the Biden team's worry that the president's fitness for the job becomes a story they lose control of, much like former President Gerald Ford's stumbles led to the perception that he was a bumbler.,"right"
Nikki Usher, a media professor at the University of San Diego, said she was surprised that Biden's team hadn't become more aggressive earlier.,"right"
The Biden pushback seems mild in comparison to Trump's epic badmouthing of news organizations like CNN and The New York Times.,"right"
Democrats, meanwhile, tend to have a greater appreciation for the press' role in a democracy, Usher says, so the Biden team has to be more careful with attacks.,"right"
Particularly with the age issue, there's only so much that the president's team can say, Sesno said: “People will make up their minds based on what they see and hear from Joe Biden.”,"right"
The first reviews are in on President-elect Joe Biden's choices for Cabinet and White House positions.,"right"
But I wonder if Biden ever had a chat with the late Bryce Harlow, who first worked for Gen.,"right"
Does Joe Biden see the need for advisers as candid and fearless as Stu Spencer around him?,"right"
Let us hope that, unlike his predecessor, who needed, even demanded, fawning tributes to himself from his subordinates and secretaries, Joe Biden has instead the emotional security of President Gerald Ford and will insist on securing his own Stu Spencer.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden’s decision to go back on his word and issue a categorical pardon for his son, Hunter, just weeks before his scheduled sentencing on gun and tax convictions was a surprise that wasn't all that surprising.,"right"
Not to those who had witnessed the president’s shared anguish over his two sons after the boys survived a car crash that killed Biden's first wife and a daughter more than a half-century ago.,"right"
He added that while he could sympathize with Hunter Biden’s struggles, “no one is above the law, not a President and not a President’s son.”,"right"
Biden aides and allies had been resigned to the prospect of the president using his extraordinary power in the waning days of his presidency to ensure his son wouldn't see time behind bars, especially after Donald Trump ’s win.,"right"
The president's supporters have long viewed Biden's commitment to his family as an asset overall, even if Hunter's personal conduct and tangled business dealings were seen as a persistent liability.,"right"
But the pardon comes as Biden has become increasingly isolated since the loss to Trump by Vice President Kamala Harris, who jumped in to the race after the president’s catastrophic debate against Trump in June forced his exit from the election.,"right"
Trump has gleefully planned to undo Biden’s signature achievements on climate change and reverse the Democrat's efforts to reinvigorate the country’s alliances, all while standing poised to take credit for a strengthening economy and billions in infrastructure investments that are in the pipeline for the coming years.,"right"
And now, Biden has handed the Republican a pretext to carry through with sweeping plans to upend the Department of Justice as the Republican vows to seek retribution against supposed adversaries.,"right"
Well, Joe Biden just made clear his son Hunter is above the law.”,"right"
Biden and his spokespeople had repeatedly and flatly ruled out the president granting his son a pardon.,"right"
In June, Biden told reporters as his son faced trial in the Delaware gun case: “I abide by the jury decision.,"right"
Neither Biden nor the White House explained the shift in the president's thinking, and it was his broken promise as much as his act of clemency that was a lightning rod.,"right"
Yet Biden held himself up as placing his respect for the American judicial system and rule of law over his own personal concerns — trying to draw a deliberate contrast with Trump, who tested the bounds of his authority like few predecessors.,"right"
Inside the White House, the timing of the pardon was surprising to some who believed Biden would put it off as long as possible, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter.,"right"
It came just after Biden spent extended time over the past week with Hunter and other family members on Nantucket in Massachusetts, a family tradition for Thanksgiving.,"right"
“I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice — and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further,” Biden said in a statement announcing the pardon.,"right"
Some in the administration have privately expressed anguish that the substance of Biden’s statement, including his claim of an unfair politically-tinged prosecution of his son, resembled complaints Trump — who faced now-abandoned indictments over his role in trying to subvert the 2020 election — has been making for years about the Justice Department.,"right"
Biden said the charges in his son's cases "came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election.” Many legal experts agreed that the charges against the younger Biden were somewhat unusual, but the facts of the offenses were hardly in dispute, as Hunter wrote about his gun purchase while addicted to illegal drugs in his memoir and ultimately pleaded guilty to the tax charges.,"right"
The pardon too was unusual, coming before Hunter Biden was even sentenced and covering not just the gun and tax offenses against his son, but also anything else he might have done going back to the start of 2014.,"right"
It's a move that could limit the ability of the Trump Justice Department to investigate the younger Biden's unsavory foreign business dealings, or to find new ground on which to bring criminal charges related to that time period.,"right"
Biden, in his statement, asked for consideration: “I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.","right"
— The Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah was a “measure of justice” for victims of a four-decade “reign of terror,” President Joe Biden said Saturday.,"right"
Biden noted that the operation to take out Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas’ massacre of Israelis on Oct.,"right"
“Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a ‘northern front’ against Israel,” Biden said in a statement.,"right"
“President Biden and I do not want to see conflict in the Middle East escalate into a broader regional war,” Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement Saturday that echoed Biden's description of a “measure of justice.” She added, “Diplomacy remains the best path forward to protect civilians and achieve lasting stability in the region.”,"right"
The confirmation of Nasrallah's death comes during a week that began with Biden’s top national security aides working on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly to build support for a 21-day Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire that they hoped might also breathe new life into stalled efforts to secure a truce in Gaza.,"right"
Biden reiterated on Saturday that he wants to see cease-fires both in Gaza and between Israel and Hezbollah.,"right"
“It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability,” Biden said.,"right"
Biden, who was spending the weekend at his vacation home in Delaware, and Harris, who was campaigning in California, held a call with national security aides on Saturday to discuss the situation in the Middle East.,"right"
In a brief exchange with reporters as he left church on Saturday, Biden did not directly respond to questions about the conflict potentially escalating further.,"right"
WASHINGTON — While Joe Biden and Donald Trump are marching toward their respective presidential nominations, Michigan's primary on Tuesday could reveal significant political perils for both of them.,"right"
Trump, despite his undoubted dominance of the Republican contests this year, is facing a bloc of stubbornly persistent GOP voters who favor his lone remaining rival, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, and who are skeptical at best about the former president's prospects in a rematch against Biden.,"right"
As for the incumbent president, Biden is confronting perhaps his most potent electoral obstacle yet: an energized movement of disillusioned voters upset with his handling of the war in Gaza and a relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that critics say has been too supportive.,"right"
Even if they post dominant victories as expected on Tuesday, both campaigns will be looking at the margins for signs of weakness in a state that went for Biden by just 3 percentage points last time.,"right"
Biden said in a local Michigan radio interview Monday that it would be “one of the five states” that would determine the winner in November.,"right"
Democrats angry that Biden has supported Israel's offensive and resisted calls for a cease-fire are rallying voters on Tuesday to instead select “uncommitted.”,"right"
Trump won the state by just 11,000 votes in 2016 over Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, and then lost the state four years later by nearly 154,000 votes to Biden.,"right"
“President Biden is failing to provide voters for whom the war crimes that are being inflicted by our U.S. taxpayer dollars — he’s failing to provide them with something to vote for.”,"right"
Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has also urged progressive voters to choose “uncommitted” on Tuesday, saying it would send a message to Biden to “change course NOW on Gaza or else risk losing Michigan to Trump in November.”,"right"
Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a Biden backer who held several meetings and listening sessions in Michigan late last week, said he told community members that, despite his disagreements over the war, he would nonetheless support Biden because he represents a much better chance of peace in the Middle East than Trump.,"right"
“I also said that I admire those who are using their ballot in a quintessentially American way to bring about a change in policy,” Khanna said Monday, adding that Biden supporters need to proactively engage with the uncommitted voters to try and “earn back their trust.”,"right"
Meanwhile, the state GOP has been riven with divisions among various pro-Trump factions, potentially weakening its power at a time when Michigan Republicans are trying to lay the groundwork to defeat Biden this fall.,"right"
Both Biden and Trump have so far dominated their respective primary bids.,"right"
Biden has sailed to wins in South Carolina, Nevada and New Hampshire, with the latter victory coming in through a write-in campaign.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden signed into law on Thursday a bill strengthening oversight of the crisis-plagued federal Bureau of Prisons after reporting by The Associated Press exposed systemic corruption, failures and abuse in the federal prison system.,"right"
Biden signed a separate Ossoff bill into law in December 2022 requiring the Bureau of Prisons to fix broken surveillance cameras and install new ones.,"right"
WASHINGTON (AP) - They mourned together and laughed together in the Oval Office -- and spoke of what President Joe Biden called 'œthe hard reality that racism has long torn us apart.'ť,"right"
Instead, Floyd's family met with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House on Tuesday to commemorate their loss and continue to push for legislation.,"right"
'œIt was a remembrance of what happened to my brother,'ť Philonise Floyd said of the meeting with Biden, calling the president 'œa genuine guy.'ť,"right"
Biden told them 'œhe just wants the bill to be meaningful and that it holds George's legacy intact,'ť said George Floyd's nephew Brandon Williams.,"right"
Williams said Biden showed 'œgenuine concern'ť for how the family is doing.,"right"
Biden took time during the meeting to play with George Floyd's young daughter Gianna, who enjoyed some ice cream and Cheetos, the president said, after she told him she was hungry.,"right"
Speaking to reporters at the end of the day, Biden said he had spoken with congressional negotiators and 'œI'm hopeful that sometime after Memorial Day we'll have an agreement.'ť,"right"
Nonetheless, the lack of a final deal contrasted sharply with advocates' high hopes just last month, when former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's conviction for Floyd's killing and then Biden's nationally televised speech to Congress calling for action by May 25 gave supporters a sense of momentum.,"right"
It's a high-profile legislative fight in which Biden has notably taken a back seat, preferring to leave the work of crafting a compromise to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, in contrast to his fevered advocacy, both public and private, for his infrastructure bill and COVID-19 relief package.,"right"
Floyd family lawyer Ben Crump said Biden told them that "he doesn't want to sign a bill that doesn't have substance and meaning.,"right"
White House advisers say Biden and his team have been in frequent touch with Capitol Hill negotiators over the legislation, but they believe this is an issue in which a high-profile public campaign by the president may do more harm than good.,"right"
'œPresident Biden has left it to members of Congress, and it's in their hands right now.,"right"
While the president is waiting for the bill to hit his desk, Biden's aides have said the administration is doing what it can to deal with the incidents of police misconduct.,"right"
The Biden administration has signaled that the Justice Department will shift its focus to prioritize civil rights and policing reform after a tumultuous four years under President Donald Trump.,"right"
On Tuesday, as Floyd's family was preparing to meet with Biden, the Senate voted to confirm Kristen Clarke as assistant attorney general for civil rights, the first Black woman to hold the position.,"right"
Ironically, the large reactors he apparently fears and ensured would remain banned are the exact reactors that the Biden administration is now calling to be built by the hundreds.,"right"
Despite Vogtle's significantly higher price tag and schedule delays, the Biden administration clearly sees the long-term benefits of gigawatt-sized nuclear reactors.,"right"
ATLANTA — Little more than a week ago, Georgia appeared to be slipping out of the Democrats' reach: President Joe Biden's campaign pledged to concentrate more on holding the Midwestern “blue wall” states and indicated they might be willing to forsake “Sun Belt” battlegrounds.,"right"
But now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Vice President Kamala Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats say they have new hope for the state.,"right"
They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia — the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 — a tossup again.,"right"
Harris is planning to make a show of political force with a rally in Atlanta on Tuesday night that will feature a performance by hip hop star Megan Thee Stallion, the latest example of just how much the race against Republican Donald Trump has shifted since Biden abandoned his reelection bid.,"right"
She will be appearing in the same city where Biden's dismal performance in a debate against Trump on June 27 sparked a Democratic revolt that ultimately ended his campaign.,"right"
In a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.,"right"
Republicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden’s lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.,"right"
But they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 — when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points — than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.,"right"
She dismissed Harris as “just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden” and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that “hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.”,"right"
“I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist — I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,” Smith said.,"right"
Former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden recently squared off in their first debate in anticipation of the presidential election in November.,"right"
According to The Associated Press, a variety of false information was presented during the event, with Trump making fake claims and Biden offering “exaggerations and embellishments.”,"right"
Biden addressed military deaths that occurred during his time in office.,"right"
“The truth is, I’m the only president this century that doesn’t have any — this decade — any troops dying anywhere in the world like he did,” Biden claimed.,"right"
Biden claimed he is responsible for lower prescription costs.,"right"
Biden claimed, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump said Americans should “inject bleach” into their arms.,"right"
I haven't spoken to President Joe Biden about this, so kindly grant me a little poetic license for a spell.,"right"
I waded through a number of transcriptions of Biden's speeches, and they're peppered with "good-paying jobs" and "good-paying union jobs.","right"
"You've done well with your life, Mr. Biden.","right"
But if you're an everyman like President Biden or former Gov.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said Monday that “extremism” on the U.S. Supreme Court is undermining public confidence in the institution and called on Congress to quickly establish term limits and an enforceable ethics code for the court's nine justices.,"right"
Biden, who has less than six months left in his presidency, detailed the contours of his court proposal in an address at the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin, Texas, where he was marking the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act.,"right"
The likely Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who has sought to frame her race against Republican ex-President Donald Trump as“a choice between freedom and chaos," quickly endorsed the Biden proposal.,"right"
“Extremism is undermining the public confidence in the court’s decisions,” Biden said.,"right"
Biden pointed to the 2013 high court decision that gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the 2022 decision overturning Roe v.,"right"
Biden in a brief exchange with reporters ahead of his address shrugged off Johnson's pronouncement that the proposal is going nowhere.,"right"
“I think that’s what he is — dead on arrival,” Biden offered.,"right"
Biden is calling for doing away with lifetime appointments to the court.,"right"
Biden also is calling on Congress to pass a constitutional amendment reversing the Supreme Court’s recent landmark immunity ruling that determined former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution.,"right"
“This nation was founded on the principle there are no kings in America,” Biden said.,"right"
“These scandals involving the justices have caused public opinion to question the court's fairness and independence that are essential to basically carrying its mission of equal justice under the law,” Biden said.,"right"
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell pushed back that Biden's proposal amounted to taking a “torch” to the “crown jewel of our system of government.”,"right"
“President Biden and his leftist allies don’t like the current composition of the court so they want to shred the Constitution to change it,” McConnell said.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is “deeply concerned” about the unauthorized release of classified documents on Israel's preparation for a potential retaliatory attack on Iran, a White House spokesman said Monday.,"right"
The Biden administration is still not certain if the classified information was leaked or hacked, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.,"right"
She added that Biden has “complete confidence” in the Pentagon, Justice Department and intelligence community following the latest unauthorized disclosure.,"right"
ATLANTA — President Joe Biden and his Republican rival, Donald Trump, will meet for a debate on Thursday that offers an unparalleled opportunity for both candidates to try to reshape the political narrative.,"right"
Biden, the Democratic incumbent, gets the chance to reassure voters that, at 81, he’s capable of guiding the U.S. through a range of challenges.,"right"
Biden and Trump enter the night facing fierce headwinds, including a public weary of the tumult of partisan politics.,"right"
Trump has promised sweeping plans to remake the U.S. government if he returns to the White House and Biden argues that his opponent would pose an existential threat to the nation's democracy.,"right"
Trump and Biden haven't been on the same stage or even spoken since their last debate weeks before the 2020 presidential election.,"right"
Trump skipped Biden’s inauguration after leading an unprecedented and unsuccessful effort to overturn his loss to Biden that culminated in the Jan.,"right"
Aiming to avoid a repeat of their chaotic 2020 matchups, Biden insisted — and Trump agreed — to hold the debate without an audience and to allow the network to mute the candidates’ microphones when it is not their turn to speak.,"right"
Biden and Trump, he said, “don’t like each other, haven’t seen each other, (are) pretty rusty heading into the biggest night of their lives.,"right"
The faceoff also occurs just after the Biden White House took executive action to restrict asylum claims at the U.S.-Mexico border in an effort to lower the number of migrants entering the country.,"right"
Biden spent the week leading up to the debate secluded at Camp David with senior White House and campaign aides as well as a coterie of longtime advisers and allies.,"right"
A mock stage was built at the compound to simulate the studio where the debate will be held, and Biden’s personal attorney, Bob Bauer, was reprising his role as Trump in practice sessions.,"right"
Aides say the work reflects Biden's understanding that he can't afford a flat showing.,"right"
Trump and his aides have spent months chronicling what they argue are signs of Biden’s diminished stamina.,"right"
In recent days, they've started to predict Biden will be stronger on Thursday, aiming to raise expectations for the incumbent.,"right"
In 2020, Biden secured Georgia’s 16 electoral votes with a margin of less than 12,000 votes out of 5 million cast.,"right"
Trump called in Friday to a gathering at Rocky’s Barbershop in the Buckhead community to talk about his matchup with Biden and question whether CNN moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash would treat him fairly.,"right"
Heading out of the debate, both Biden and Trump will travel to states they hope to swing their way this fall.,"right"
Biden is set to jet off to North Carolina, where he is expected to hold the largest-yet rally of his campaign in a state Trump narrowly carried in 2020.,"right"
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden ordered expansive election-year action Tuesday to offer potential citizenship to hundreds of thousands of immigrants without legal status in the U.S., aiming to balance his recent aggressive crackdown on the southern border that enraged advocates and many Democratic lawmakers.,"right"
The action by Biden, a Democrat, could affect upwards of half a million immigrants, according to senior administration officials.,"right"
It still stands for who we are," Biden said from a crowded East Room at the White House, filled with advocates, congressional Democrats and immigrants who would be eligible for the program.,"right"
Biden’s action, which amounts to the most expansive federal protection for immigrants in over a decade, sets up a significant political contrast with presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, whose hardline stance on immigration includes a push for mass deportations and rhetoric casting migrants as dangerous criminals “poisoning the blood” of America.,"right"
On Tuesday, Biden accused “my predecessor” of preying on fears about immigrants as he chastised Trump administration moves, such as a zero-tolerance policy at the southern border that led to the separation of families.,"right"
But Trump has leaned into his own policies as Biden has faced disapproval of his handling of immigration throughout his presidency.,"right"
At a rally in Racine, Wisconsin, on Tuesday, Trump proclaimed, “When I’m reelected, Joe Biden’s illegal amnesty plan will be ripped up and thrown out on the very first day that we’re back in office.”,"right"
Because the shadow of a second Trump administration looms over Biden’s new policy, Tuesday’s actions will set off a months-long sprint by Latino organizations to get as many people to apply for the program as possible before next January.,"right"
To qualify for Biden's actions, an immigrant must have lived in the United States for 10 years and be married to a U.S. citizen, both as of Monday.,"right"
Biden formally unveiled his plans at a Tuesday event at the White House, which also marked the 12th anniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, a popular Obama-era directive that offered deportation protections and temporary work permits for young immigrants who lack legal status.,"right"
Republicans were making their own sharp contrasts with Biden's plan.,"right"
Richard Hudson, chair of House Republicans' campaign arm, called the Biden policy a “mass amnesty plan.” Other Republicans, such as Texas Gov.,"right"
Tuesday’s announcement came two weeks after Biden unveiled a sweeping crackdown at the U.S.-Mexico border that effectively halted asylum claims for those arriving between officially designated ports of entry.,"right"
Immigrant-rights groups have sued the Biden administration over that directive, which a senior administration official said Monday had led to fewer border encounters between ports.,"right"
Biden's allies believe that the approach he is taking with his twin actions on immigration this month will resonate with voters.,"right"
Among advocates, Gustavo Torres, the executive director of CASA, said Biden’s announcement would energize Latino communities to get out and support him.,"right"
“This is what our communities have needed to rally behind President Biden for reelection,” he said.,"right"
Biden also announced new regulations that will allow certain DACA beneficiaries and other young immigrants to more easily qualify for long-established work visas.,"right"
The power that Biden is invoking with his Tuesday announcement for spouses is not a novel one.,"right"
Bush and Barack Obama to allow “parole in place” for family members of military members, said Andrea Flores, a former policy adviser in the Obama and Biden administrations who is now a vice president at FWD.us, an immigration advocacy organization.,"right"
The same progressives who were infuriated with Biden’s asylum order praised the president on Tuesday.,"right"
Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who leads the Congressional Progressive Caucus, commended Biden and said the actions would help keep American families together.,"right"
The president's son, Eric Trump, on Wednesday retweeted a video that makes it appear Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is reading from prepared notes during an interview.,"right"
"Biden caught red-handed using a teleprompter," reads a headline on the meme.,"right"
It also includes the quote, apparently from Biden, "OK, I lost that line," followed by a scrunched-face emoji.,"right"
But Biden wasn't reading from a teleprompter during the Sept.,"right"
</URL>During the interview, Biden took questions from viewers.,"right"
The line attributed to Biden in the meme is also inaccurate.,"right"
When it appeared there was trouble with the connection, Biden said, "OK, I lost that lady." Diaz-Balart began to speak as Biden said "lady," distorting the last word.,"right"
Diaz-Balart later told the Post that Biden said, "I lost the lady," when the "monitor went to black.","right"
Facts Matter: Video clips edited to make Trump, Biden look bad,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden has made it clear basically any which way you ask him: he's definitely, assuredly, “one thousand percent” staying in the presidential race.,"right"
Here are the things Biden has cited — some serious, others not — that would make him reconsider his run:,"right"
It was a defiant answer that indicated Biden had no intention whatsoever of dropping out.,"right"
During an ABC News interview that marked the first major test of his fitness for office, anchor George Stephanopoulos asked the 81-year-old Biden whether he had convinced himself that only he could defeat his Republican opponent, Donald Trump.,"right"
“I have convinced myself of two things,” Biden said.,"right"
“It depends,” Biden responded.,"right"
No politician ever wants to lose — and it seems Biden would be willing to exit if he had numerical proof that that's what would happen.,"right"
In a news conference at the close of the NATO summit in Washington last week, Biden was asked whether he would step aside if aides showed him that Vice President Kamala Harris would be a stronger opponent than he would be against Trump.,"right"
Biden's initial response was “no,” but then he elaborated.,"right"
Biden wasn't directly asked the hypothetical, but he threw in a new scenario anyway.,"right"
As Speedy Morman, a host on the entertainment network Complex, was wrapping up his interview with Biden last week in Detroit, he had one more closing question for the president: “We will 1,000 percent — in your words — see you on the ballot this November?”,"right"
Quipped Biden: “Unless I get hit by a train, yeah.”,"right"
Biden spoke with BET journalist Ed Gordon for an interview set to air Wednesday night.,"right"
During the conversation, Gordon asked Biden if there were any factors that would make him reevaluate his candidacy.,"right"
“If I had some medical condition that emerged,” Biden told Gordon.,"right"
The health of Biden, the oldest person to be U.S. president, has been scrutinized well before his catastrophic debate performance.,"right"
After his latest physical in February, presidential doctor Kevin O’Connor said Biden “remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.” A neurological exam, taken more than a month prior, showed no signs of a stroke, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease, according to O'Connor.,"right"
Biden tested positive for COVID-19 Wednesday while trying to shore up support among disenchanted voters key to his reelection chances.,"right"
DES MOINES, Iowa - When Joe Biden was last in Iowa, his presidential campaign was on the verge of collapse and he was soundly trounced in the caucuses by a former Indiana mayor nearly 40 years his junior.,"right"
Biden's trip reflects the remarkable arc of his third presidential campaign.,"right"
But Democrats have rallied behind Biden as their best candidate to defeat President Donald Trump and unify a country facing health, economic and social crises.,"right"
And the money woes that plagued Biden during the primary have vanished as he's built a nearly two-to-one cash advantage over Trump that's allowed him to flood the airwaves and make ambitious plays for states like Iowa, which flipped to Republican in 2016.,"right"
The dramatic nature of Biden's rise is eclipsed only by the challenges faced by Trump - whose confidence in his reelection was dealt a devastating blow by the coronavirus pandemic this spring, with the public health and economic crises still rearing their heads in the days leading up to the close of polling.,"right"
"I don't take anything for granted," Biden told reporters Friday.,"right"
With four days until the election and more than 80 million votes already cast, time is running out for Trump and Biden to change the shape of the race.,"right"
Biden is leading most national polls and has a narrow advantage in many of the critical battlegrounds that could decide the race.,"right"
After Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota on Friday, Biden will hit Michigan on Saturday, where he'll hold a joint rally with former President Barack Obama.,"right"
Biden will close out his campaign Monday hitting a familiar battleground: Pennsylvania, the state where he was born and the one he's visited more than any other this campaign.,"right"
The Biden campaign announced the candidate, his wife Jill, Sen.,"right"
Biden has held fewer events in a nod to the restrictions in place across the country to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.,"right"
Biden's running mate, California Sen.,"right"
Biden, meanwhile, is pouring tens of millions of dollars into a torrent of online advertising that will deliver his closing message of the presidential campaign, highlighting his promise to govern for all Americans while blasting Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.,"right"
"I will work as hard for those who don't support me as those who do," Biden says in one of the digital ads, which took over the masthead of YouTube Thursday.,"right"
As Biden aimed to hold his election night event in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, Trump, who had been scheduled to hold a party at his Washington, D.C. hotel, appeared to be rethinking plans as a result of the city's COVID-19 restrictions.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Tuesday decried a “ferocious surge” in antisemitism on college campuses and around the globe in the months since Hamas attacked Israel and triggered a war in Gaza, using a ceremony to remember victims of the Holocaust to also denounce new waves of violence and hateful rhetoric toward Jews.,"right"
Biden said that on Oct.,"right"
While acknowledging the ceremony was taking place during “difficult times,” Biden made no explicit reference to the deaths of more than 34,700 Palestinians since the attack by Hamas led Israel to declare war in Gaza.,"right"
“My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad, even when we disagree,” Biden said.,"right"
“We’re at risk of people not knowing the truth," Biden said of the horrors of the Holocaust, when 6 million Jews were systematically killed by Nazi Germany and its collaborators.,"right"
Biden steered clear of the upcoming presidential election in his speech.,"right"
Biden’s remarks at the Capitol played out as pro-Palestinian protests — some of which have involved antisemitic chants and threats toward Jewish students and supporters of Israel — rock college campuses across the country.,"right"
“As Jews around the world still cope with the atrocity and trauma of that day and its aftermath, we’ve seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world,” Biden said.,"right"
“Not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting, they're already forgetting, that Hamas unleashed this terror that it was Hamas that brutalized Israelis, that it was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages," Biden said.,"right"
The campus protests have posed a political challenge for Biden, whose coalition has historically relied on younger voters, many of whom are critical of his public support for Israel.,"right"
Biden said “There’s no place on any campus in America” or any place in America for antisemitism or threats of violence.,"right"
In conjunction with Biden’s speech, his administration was announcing new steps to combat antisemitism on colleges campuses and beyond.,"right"
The video shows images of Trump visiting Israel and speeches he has given pledging to stand with Jewish people and confront antisemitism, while showing footage of the protests on campuses and clips of Biden responding to protesters upset with his administration’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas.,"right"
One of the clips shows Biden saying, “They have a point,” but it does not include the next sentence in which Biden said, “We need to get a lot more care into Gaza.”,"right"
Biden campaign spokesman James Singer said in response that “President Biden stands against antisemitism and is committed to the safety of the Jewish community, and security of Israel — Donald Trump does not.”,"right"
WASHINGTON — As he campaigned for the presidency, Joe Biden promised to spend billions of dollars to “save the world” from climate change.,"right"
Officials, board members and major investors in First Solar, the largest domestic maker of solar panels, donated at least $1.5 million to Biden’s successful 2020 bid for the White House.,"right"
It has also paid massive dividends as First Solar became perhaps the biggest beneficiary from $1 trillion in environmental spending enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022 after it cleared Congress solely with Democratic votes.,"right"
Ahead of what's shaping up to be a tight race for the White House this year, Biden and fellow Democrats point to the legislation as an example of investing in alternative energy in ways that'll help the environment and lift the economy.,"right"
Angelo Fernández Hernández, a White House spokesperson, didn't directly address First Solar’s efforts to curry favor with the Biden administration.,"right"
“President Biden has led and delivered on the most ambitious climate agenda in history,” Fernández Hernández said in a statement.,"right"
When the Biden administration started writing rules to implement the Democrats’ new law, First Solar executives and lobbyists met at least four times in late 2022 and 2023 with administration officials, including John Podesta, who oversaw the measure’s environmental provisions.,"right"
Ebrahimi, along with his wife and family, contributed at least $1 million to Biden’s election effort, according to campaign finance disclosures.,"right"
I think that Joe Biden exceeds all other presidential candidates in his capable wisdom.,"right"
Whether bargaining for peace, fighting Russian aggression, forgiving student loans, rebuilding the US economy or standing with striking workers, Biden brings the wisdom gained from years of experience.,"right"
Joe Biden is Franklin's natural political heir.,"right"
WASHINGTON — After 1,080 days as president, Joe Biden on Friday decided to pop in and take questions in the White House briefing room for the first time, striding in with a grin after a strong monthly jobs report and the temporary settlement of a strike by ports workers.,"right"
I don’t know whether it will be peaceful,” Biden said.,"right"
Biden has tried to rebut a political movement that has at times openly trafficked in conspiracy theories, with the latest revolving around the government reporting Friday that employers added 254,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1%.,"right"
“Another fake jobs report out from Biden-Harris government today,” Sen.,"right"
“But all the fake numbers in the world aren’t going to fool people dealing with the Biden-Harris economic disaster every day.”,"right"
But Biden stressed that he was operating on valid data despite unfounded claims of falsification by supporters of Trump’s Make America Great Again movement.,"right"
“If you notice, anything the MAGA Republicans don't like they call ‘fake,’” Biden said.,"right"
Still, challenges remain for Biden as his final months as president involve the risk of a wider war in the Middle East.,"right"
When asked, Biden clarified his comments from a day earlier about Israel possibly striking Iranian oil facilities, which caused the price of the commodity to jump on the prospect of supplies being squeezed.,"right"
“Look, the Israelis have not concluded what they’re going to do in terms of a strike,” Biden said Friday.,"right"
As Biden began to leave the room, he was asked if he would reconsider his decision to exit the race.,"right"
Biden cocked his head and smiled.,"right"
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden turned his State of the Union speech Thursday night into an animated argument for a second term as he laced into GOP front-runner Donald Trump for espousing “resentment, revenge and retribution" and jeopardizing freedom at home and abroad.,"right"
Over and over, Biden delivered broadsides at “my predecessor” without mentioning Trump by name, raising his voice as he tried to quell voter concerns about his age and job performance while sharpening the contrast with his all-but-certain November rival.,"right"
It was a far different — and feistier tone — from Biden than in his previous State of the Union address, and it was designed to banish doubts about whether the 81-year-old is still up to the job he bids for a second term.,"right"
Biden goaded Republicans over their policies, invited call-and-response banter with fellow Democrats and seemed to revel in the fight.,"right"
“Freedom and democracy are under attack both at home and overseas at the very same time,” Biden said as he appealed for Congress to support Ukraine's efforts to defend itself against Russia's invasion.,"right"
Biden quickly pivoted to the threats at home, referencing the Jan.,"right"
6 — I will not do that," Biden said.,"right"
“My lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy,” Biden said.,"right"
White House aides said Biden was aiming to prove his doubters wrong by flashing his combative side and trying to needle Republicans over positions he believes are out of step with the country, particularly on access to abortion, but also tax policy and healthcare.,"right"
Taking a victory lap in selling his legislative accomplishments, such as one that bolsters manufacturing of computer chips nationwide, Biden veered from his prepared script to take a dig at Republicans who voted against such policies but are eager to take credit for them back home.,"right"
“If any of you don’t want that money in your districts,” Biden said, “just let me know.”,"right"
Biden aides inside the White House and on his campaign had hoped for some fresh viral moments — like when he tussled last year with heckling Republicans and chided them for past efforts to cut Medicare and Social Security.,"right"
A number of House Republicans began to stand up and leave the chamber as Biden discussed raising taxes on billionaires and corporations.,"right"
Biden engaged in a loud call and response with lawmakers as he rhetorically questioned whether the tax code was fair and whether billionaires and corporations need “another $2 trillion in tax breaks,” as he charged Republicans want.,"right"
And congressional Republican leaders were showcasing one of their newest lawmakers through the State of the Union rebuttal in order to make a generational contrast with Biden.,"right"
Biden painted an optimistic future for the country as the massive pieces of legislation he signed into law during his first two years in office are implemented.,"right"
Trump, for his part, said he planned to respond in real time to Biden's remarks on his Truth Social platform.,"right"
This year, Biden faced heightened emotions — particularly among his base supporters — over his staunch backing for Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza.,"right"
Biden’s motorcade took a circuitous route to the Capitol, as hundreds of pro-cease-fire demonstrators tried to disrupt its path from the White House.,"right"
Amid growing concerns about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, Biden announced in his address that he has directed the U.S. military to establish a temporary port on the Gaza coast aimed at increasing the flow of aid into the beleaguered territory.,"right"
Access to abortion and fertility treatments was also a key component of Biden's speech, especially in light of a controversial ruling from Alabama’s Supreme Court that has upended access to in vitro fertilization treatment in the state.,"right"
One of first lady Jill Biden's guests for the speech was Kate Cox, who sued Texas, and ultimately left her home state, to obtain an emergency abortion after a severe fetal anomaly was detected.,"right"
Wade as the law of the land again,” Biden said.,"right"
The White House also invited union leaders, a gun control advocate, and others that Jill Biden and her husband have met as they traveled the country promoting his agenda.,"right"
Going into the State of the Union, Biden also has raised the problems of “shrinkflation” – companies putting fewer pretzels in the jar and less yogurt in sealed cups — and so-called “junk fees” on services.,"right"
Neither is a prime driver of inflation, but the White House hopes to show consumers that Biden is fighting for them.,"right"
Biden also unveiled an expanded plan to raise corporate taxes and use the proceeds to trim budget deficits and cut taxes for the middle class.,"right"
Biden entered the speech with work to do shoring up his standing.,"right"
The same survey found that more than 6 in 10 (63%) say they’re not very or not at all confident in Biden’s mental capability to serve effectively as president.,"right"
The already intense scrutiny of Biden’s age was magnified when special counsel Robert Hur raised questions about the president’s mental acuity in his report last month on Biden’s handling of classified information.,"right"
Following the speech, Biden was set for a weekend of campaign travel, holding events in Pennsylvania on Friday and Georgia on Saturday.,"right"
The Biden campaign said it would host more than 200 watch parties around the country Thursday night, including in cities, suburbs and rural towns in battleground states.,"right"
Campaign officials will use the events to recruit volunteers and encourage others to get involved in Biden's reelection effort.,"right"
GENEVA (AP) - President Joe Biden's top medical adviser on COVID-19, Dr. Anthony Fauci, on Thursday announced renewed U.S. support for the World Health Organization after it faced blistering criticism from the Trump administration, laying out new commitments to tackle the coronavirus and other global health issues.,"right"
Just hours after Biden's inauguration on Wednesday, his administration announced the U.S. will revoke a planned pullout from the WHO in July that had been announced by the Trump administration.,"right"
Fauci said the Biden administration 'œwill cease the drawdown of U.S. staff seconded to the WHO'ť and resume 'œregular engagement'ť with WHO.,"right"
Other countries and the WHO chief jumped in to welcome the U.S. announcements, and pledged to work with the Biden administration.,"right"
'œThis is a good day for WHO and a good day for global health,'ť Tedros said, referring to 'œmy brother Tony'ť in reference to Fauci, while congratulating Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris.,"right"
Because of COVID, President Joe Biden campaigned from home in 2020.,"right"
But after American classrooms and businesses reopened, Biden has been a frequently absent executive since he took the oath of office.,"right"
Ernst figured Biden “was out of office 532 days over the last three-and-a-half years, about 40% of the time he was expected to be in the Oval Office.”,"right"
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin didn't bother to inform Biden when he was hospitalized for days.,"right"
The Biden administration has been in no hurry to get federal workers back to the office — to the displeasure of D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, as well as area eateries and businesses.,"right"
Sort of like Joe Biden.,"right"
“From Day One, my administration has been committed to fixing the broken student loan system,” President Joe Biden said to begin a video about his latest attempt to buy the college-graduate vote.,"right"
Whenever Biden calls something “broken,” reach for your wallet.,"right"
According to the White House, Biden's student-loan forgiveness package should result in 4 million Americans seeing their college debt wiped clean; more than 10 million enjoying a reduction of $5,000 in debt relief; and the elimination of accrued interest for 23 million additional borrowers.,"right"
As November approaches and young liberals have shown themselves unenthusiastic about the incumbent, Team Biden is spinning this scheme as a noble effort opposed by Republicans, who stopped Biden's first effort to “forgive” student loans unilaterally by executive order.,"right"
Several times we have heard that the party is or was ignoring or cheating the 14 million primary voters who voted for President Biden.,"right"
It is quite possible that any poll of those 14 million voters for Biden would now show a large approval that Biden’s decision to withdraw has become what appears to be a good one.,"right"
The Democrats looked hard at the polls and urged Biden to make a decision to help preserve a joyful democracy against what continues to look like an dark autocratic alternative.,"right"
The White House confirmed Monday that a neurologist who is an expert in Parkinson’s disease has evaluated President Biden three times, saying that the tests were part of the president’s annual physical exams.,"right"
“President Biden has not seen a neurologist outside of his annual physical.”,"right"
The White House has faced questions over Biden’s cognitive health following his halting performance in a prime-time debate against rival Donald Trump last month, where the 81-year-old president frequently stumbled over his words or seemed to lose his train of thought.,"right"
The White House also has declined to make O’Connor, Biden’s longtime physician, available for interviews.,"right"
House Republicans on Sunday demanded that O’Connor testify about his relationship with Biden and why he has declined to order a cognitive test for the president.,"right"
She said Biden had seen a neurologist for each of his three annual physicals but declined to provide more detail.,"right"
Several reporters accused Jean-Pierre of withholding critical information about Biden’s health.,"right"
Brad Schneider of Highland Park on Thursday joined the growing number of Democratic officials calling for President Joe Biden to end his reelection bid.,"right"
In a news release, Schneider said the time has come “for President Biden to heroically pass the torch to a new generation of leadership to guide us to the future he has enabled and empowered us to pursue.”,"right"
In a follow-up telephone conversation with the Daily Herald, Schneider said Biden’s much-criticized debate performance two weeks ago and his subsequent televised interview with ABC News were turning points for him.,"right"
A flood of communications from constituents about Biden’s ability to serve also was a factor, Schneider said.,"right"
“It’s been highlighted to an extreme the last couple weeks,” Schneider said, referring to what he called a “lack of enthusiasm” for a second Biden term.,"right"
Schneider, who represents the North and Northwest suburban 10th District, is the second member of Illinois’ Democratic congressional delegation to publicly say Biden should drop out of the race against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.,"right"
Their pleas — and the those of other Democratic lawmakers and high-profile party donors — follow Biden’s much-criticized performance.,"right"
Biden has remained resolute, insisting he’ll continue running for a second term.,"right"
Schneider is a longtime Biden ally who shared a stage with the then-vice president for a 2014 political rally in Vernon Hills and endorsed his first presidential campaign early in 2020.,"right"
By stepping aside now, Biden has a chance to “seal his place in history as one of the greatest leaders our nation, and history, has ever known,” Schneider said.,"right"
But if Biden stays in the race, Americans will “be resigned to slog through this election praying we can successfully defend our democracy.”,"right"
Schneider didn’t say who should run in Biden’s place.,"right"
In addition to Schneider and Quigley, one U.S. senator and nearly a dozen other members of the House have called for Biden to drop out.,"right"
Other high-profile Democrats, including Pritzker, have expressed concern about Biden’s chances if he stays in the race.,"right"
Biden is scheduled to be named the Democratic nominee at his party’s national convention in Chicago in August.,"right"
Schneider, who represents the suburban 10th District, is making a stand and refusing to co-sponsor legislation or share leadership roles with Republicans who continue to deny Joe Biden fairly won the 2020 presidential election.,"right"
Trent Kelly, voted to overturn Biden's win.,"right"
Still, not all of the Republicans who voted against certifying Biden's victory have found themselves on the outs with the Democratic majority.,"right"
Jody Hice of Georgia even though Hice voted against certifying Biden's win.,"right"
Schneider said his standard won't keep him from backing legislation put forth by lawmakers who voted against confirming Biden - assuming the bills are good for constituents.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will accept endorsements from at least 15 members of the Kennedy political family during a campaign stop in Philadelphia on Thursday as he aims to undermine former President Donald Trump and marginalize the candidacy of Robert F.,"right"
Kennedy and sister of the current presidential contender, will deliver the endorsements of Biden, his campaign announced.,"right"
The decision to highlight the Kennedy family endorsement more than six months from Election Day is an indication of how seriously Biden's team is taking the threat of the long shot bid potentially using his last name’s lingering Democratic magic to siphon off support from the president.,"right"
Biden was using the event, which caps a three-day campaign swing in a battleground state critical to his reelection effort, to also sustain the pressure on Trump.,"right"
Just as President Biden does today.”,"right"
The endorsement was hardly a surprise, as the prominent Democratic family has been vocal that they don't see eye to eye politically with Robert Kennedy Jr., who started as a protest primary challenger to Biden in the Democratic party and now is running as an independent.,"right"
Biden last month hosted more than 30 members of Kennedy’s extended family at the White House for St. Patrick’s Day, with family members posing with the president in the Rose Garden and Oval Office.,"right"
After the formal endorsement, Biden and members of the Kennedy family were set to meet with supporters at a campaign event, and members of the Kennedy clan were planning to make calls to voters and knock on doors on Biden's behalf.,"right"
Several notable members of the family were not endorsing, including U.S. Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy and nonprofit leader Maria Shriver, which the Biden campaign said was due to their nonpolitical professional roles.,"right"
Kennedy is also viewed warily by the Trump campaign, which is fearful that he could also pull the GOP voters they need to defeat Biden in November.,"right"
While Trump has released a recent video saying, “If I were a Democrat, I’d vote for RFK Jr. every single time over Biden,” he has also sometimes criticized Kennedy, including suggesting that he is more “radical left” than the incumbent president.,"right"
It was an opportunity for Biden to reconnect with his roots, starting on Tuesday in Scranton, where he lived until he was 10 years old.,"right"
Biden’s next stop was Pittsburgh, where he called for higher tariffs on steel and aluminum from China to protect U.S. industry from what he called unfair competition.,"right"
But even that event involved some nostalgia, as Biden recalled an endorsement from the steelworkers when he was “a 29-year-old kid” from Delaware running for U.S. Senate.,"right"
WASHINGTON - The mayors of Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles and New York are pressing to meet with President Joe Biden about getting federal help in managing the surge of migrants they say are arriving in their cities with little to no coordination, support or resources from his administration.,"right"
The Democratic leaders say in a letter obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday that while they appreciate Biden's efforts so far, much more needs to be done to ease the burden on their cities.,"right"
Republicans claim Biden is soft on border security and is allowing too many people to enter the United States.,"right"
Biden has requested $1.4 billion from Congress to help state and local governments provide shelter and services for migrants, after earlier pleas from Democratic mayors and governors.,"right"
It's unclear whether Congress, including the Republican-controlled House, will pass any of the funding Biden has requested, let alone an increase for local support.,"right"
TRIANGLE, Virginia — President Joe Biden marked Earth Day by announcing $7 billion in federal grants for residential solar projects serving 900,000-plus households in low- and middle-income communities.,"right"
“Despite the overwhelming devastation in red and blue states, there are still those who deny the climate is in crisis,” Biden said.,"right"
Biden used executive action last year to create the American Climate Corps modeled on Roosevelt’s New Deal.,"right"
Biden's announcements come as he is working to energize young voters for his reelection campaign.,"right"
Biden's campaign is hoping that his climate efforts can energize young voters ahead of November.,"right"
Senior administration officials said young Americans are keenly invested in the Biden climate agenda and want to help enact it and that the Climate Corps is a way to do so.,"right"
It’s great to see President Biden jump-start this landmark program.”,"right"
None of them had the clout or sophistication of Hunter Biden, a Yale Law School graduate who was found guilty Tuesday on three felony counts involving his purchase of a gun in 2018 while he was addicted to and using crack.,"right"
But the evidence against Hunter Biden in this case was overwhelming.,"right"
If you read his memoir, “Beautiful Things,” you know that Hunter Biden was guilty, and he knew he was guilty.,"right"
The younger Biden apparently thought he would snow a courtroom — and charm jurors into not believing the mountain of evidence gathered against him.,"right"
Cable TV talking heads talk about this story as a cautionary tale about the scourge of drug addiction, when really, it's also about the younger Biden's sense of entitlement and failure to accept responsibility.,"right"
There's a pattern here with Hunter Biden.,"right"
Weiss also noted that it was “the combination of guns and drugs that made (Biden's) conduct dangerous.”,"right"
It was President Joe Biden's misfortune that he was scheduled to speak at an Everytown for Gun Safety event Tuesday afternoon.,"right"
Later in the day, the Bidens flew home to Wilmington, where they could be with their son.,"right"
After the guilty verdict, Biden reacted appropriately.,"right"
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is facing criticism from Donald Trump's campaign and religious conservatives for proclaiming March 31 — which corresponds with Easter Sunday this year — as “Transgender Day of Visibility.”,"right"
Trump's campaign accused Biden, a Roman Catholic, of being insensitive to religion, and fellow Republicans piled on.,"right"
"We call on Joe Biden’s failing campaign and White House to issue an apology to the millions of Catholics and Christians across America who believe tomorrow is for one celebration only — the resurrection of Jesus Christ," said Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's press secretary.,"right"
She assailed what she called the Biden administration's "years-long assault on the Christian faith.”,"right"
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said on social media that the “Biden White House has betrayed the central tenet of Easter” and called the decision “outrageous and abhorrent.”,"right"
White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said the Republicans criticizing Biden “are seeking to divide and weaken our country with cruel, hateful and dishonest rhetoric.”,"right"
“As a Christian who celebrates Easter with family, President Biden stands for bringing people together and upholding the dignity and freedoms of every American," Bates said.,"right"
"President Biden will never abuse his faith for political purposes or for profit.”,"right"
Biden first issued a proclamation on transgender visibility in 2021.,"right"
Biden devoutly attends Mass and considers his Catholic upbringing to be a core part of his morality and identity.,"right"
But Biden's political stances on gay marriage and support for women having the right to abortion have put him at odds with many conservative Christians.,"right"
WASHINGTON — The presidential debate was a rerun that featured two candidates with a combined age of 159, but it went especially poorly for one of them, President Joe Biden.,"right"
Already fighting voter concerns about his age, Biden, 81, was halting and seemed to lose his train of thought Thursday night, sparking quick concerns among Democrats about the man they hope will keep former President Donald Trump from returning to office.,"right"
But Trump seemed smoother and more vigorous than Biden, who is only three years older than the Republican ex-president.,"right"
Biden doesn't allay fears about his age,"right"
Biden was often halting, his voice raspy, even when he had the facts on his side.,"right"
Biden's supporters consistently express concern about the president's age and capacity and he did little to reassure them.,"right"
One of the first glimpses viewers got of Biden was when he lost his train of thought while making his case on tax rates and the number of billionaires in America — trailing off and looking down at his lectern before mumbling briefly and saying “we finally beat Medicare.” When he tried to finish his point, he was cut off because of the time limits.,"right"
At other times, Biden made some puzzling non sequiturs that seemed to undercut what the campaign has said are his strong points, including the economy and abortion rights.,"right"
As Biden critiqued Trump's economic record, the president suddenly pivoted to Afghanistan and how Trump “didn’t do anything about that” — although the botched withdrawal of Afghanistan is widely considered one of the lowest points of Biden's presidency.,"right"
Later, as Biden singled out state restrictions on abortion, he confusingly pivoted to immigration and referred to a “young woman who was just murdered” by an immigrant.,"right"
6 attackers, giving Biden an opening,"right"
He defended the people who stormed the Capitol, blaming Biden for prosecuting them.,"right"
“What they’ve done to some people who are so innocent, you ought to be ashamed of yourself,” Trump told Biden.,"right"
6 could face criminal charges, as could Biden himself.,"right"
Biden shot back: “The only person on this stage who’s a convicted felon is the man I’m looking at.”,"right"
Biden hits Trump on conviction, allegation of sex with a porn star,"right"
In what may well be a first in a presidential campaign, Trump called the president, Biden, a “criminal” and said he could well be prosecuted after he leaves office.,"right"
Biden then brought Trump’s recent criminal trial in New York in which prosecutors presented evidence that Trump had sex with a porn actor.,"right"
On abortion, Trump falsely says everyone is happy, and Biden misses an opportunity,"right"
“The idea that the founders wanted the politicians to be the ones making the decisions about women’s health is ridiculous,” Biden shot back.,"right"
But when it was his turn to speak, Biden stumbled through his explanation of Roe, which he said “had three trimesters” — a lost opportunity for the Democrat to make a strong rhetorical case on an issue vital for his party.,"right"
“The first time is between a woman and a doctor,” Biden continued.,"right"
Trump blunts Biden's border progress with dark rhetoric,"right"
In recent months, Biden has tried to reverse his poor public standing over his handling of immigration, first by endorsing a bipartisan Senate proposal with some of the toughest border restrictions in recent memory and then, after that legislation collapsed, taking executive action to clamp down on migrants seeking asylum at the southern border.,"right"
But as Biden tried to tout the progress he’s made, particularly the 40% drop in illegal border crossings since his border directive was implemented this month, Trump invoked his trademark dark and catastrophic rhetoric to paint a portrait of a chaotic border under Biden’s watch.,"right"
It's the economy, and Trump says Biden is stupid,"right"
The debate began with Biden defending his record on the economy, saying he inherited an economy that was “in a free fall” as it was battered by the coronavirus pandemic and that his administration put it back together again.,"right"
But after Biden touted his administration’s accomplishments — such as lowering the cost of insulin and the creation of millions of new jobs — Trump boasted that he oversaw the “greatest economy in the history of our country” and defended his record on the pandemic.,"right"
Biden retorted: “He’s the only one who thinks that.” But Trump responding by attacking him on inflation, arguing that he inherited low rates of inflation when he came into office in January 2021 yet prices “blew up under his leadership.”,"right"
One of Biden's strongest moments is about veterans,"right"
Biden — whose deceased son, Beau, served in Iraq — had one of his most forceful moments when he went on the attack against Trump’s reported comments in 2018 that he declined to visit a U.S. military cemetery in France because veterans buried there were “suckers” and “losers.”,"right"
It was an argument that Biden, then the Democratic challenger, made against Trump in their first 2020 debate and one that the incumbent president has regularly used against Trump, framing him as a commander in chief who nonetheless disparages veterans.,"right"
“My son was not a loser, was not a sucker,” Biden said.,"right"
WASHINGTON - With heat waves spreading across the United States, President Joe Biden on Thursday plans to unveil new steps to protect workers, improve weather forecasts and make drinking water more accessible, the White House says.,"right"
Biden's plans represent an effort to address the immediate effects of climate change as he faces pressure from fellow Democrats and labor groups to do more to safeguard vulnerable populations.,"right"
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre described the heat waves as "a difficult time" and said Biden was treating climate change with "the urgency it requires.","right"
Biden is directing the Department of Labor to increase inspections of potentially dangerous workplaces such as farms and construction sites.,"right"
The Biden administration plans to spend $7 million to develop more detailed weather predictions to anticipate extreme weather like heat waves, plus $152 million to boost drinking water infrastructure and climate resilience in California, Colorado and Washington.,"right"
Biden will be joined on Thursday by the leaders of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.,"right"
Thursday's announcement follows other steps that the Biden administration has taken to adapt to increasing threats from extreme heat.,"right"
MILWAUKEE — The Illinois Republican delegation is confident of a Trump victory in November, whether Joe Biden is his opponent or not.,"right"
But lurking in the background was news of President Biden’s latest bout with COVID and talk of him pulling out of the race.,"right"
“We would like to see Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, because we think that is a slam dunk win for us,” Palatine Township Republican Committeeman Aaron Del Mar said.,"right"
“The dump Biden movement continues to get stronger every single day,” U.S. Rep.,"right"
Joe Biden can’t do that.”,"right"
and Assistant House Minority Leader John Cabello said he still believes Biden will remain on the ticket.,"right"
He added that he does not think Trump cares who the next Democratic nominee is, if it isn’t Biden.,"right"
We won’t know for months if President Joe Biden’s historic decision to end his reelection bid so a potentially stronger Democratic candidate can face Republican Donald Trump in November’s election was a smart one — but it was the only move to make as his campaign foundered, an Illinois political expert said.,"right"
“All the dynamics pointed to a Biden loss and possibly a real meltdown, which could have hurt down-ballot Democratic candidates,” said Kent Redfield, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Illinois Springfield.,"right"
“They needed a reset and Biden was unlikely to provide it.”,"right"
Within hours of Biden’s announcement Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris became the leading contender to receive the nomination at next month’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago.,"right"
And assuming that comes to fruition, Harris likely will be a tougher political target for Republicans than Biden, said Melissa Mouritsen, a political science professor at College of DuPage in Glen Ellyn.,"right"
“She campaigns better than Biden, but because the Biden administration did not give her good projects to work on that would give her tangible results to use, its hard to know what she would campaign on,” Mouritsen said.,"right"
“Inflation aside, Biden has some real accomplishments and has done many good things,” she said.,"right"
Despite Biden’s status as the leader of the Democratic Party, his campaign lost significant support after a widely panned debate performance last month.,"right"
Democratic lawmakers who formerly had been staunch Biden backers began calling for the 80-year-old president to withdraw from the race and cede the nomination to a younger and more energetic candidate — and those calls grew louder as time passed.,"right"
But another disastrous public appearance by Biden would have destroyed his chances to stay in office as well as the Democrats’ chances of holding control of the U.S. Senate or winning a majority in the U.S. House, Redfield said.,"right"
The impact of Biden’s withdrawal from the race on his presidential legacy depends on whether the maneuver is successful for the Democratic Party, Redfield said.,"right"
Mouritsen, however, believes Biden’s delay in stepping aside already has hurt his legacy.,"right"
Mouritsen doesn’t think Biden’s withdrawal from the presidential race will affect down-ballot contests in Illinois, where Democrats control the General Assembly and every statewide office.,"right"
Suburban Democrats hail ‘selfless’ Biden; GOP leader slams ‘years of lies’,"right"

Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s son, has been indicted twice on 12 criminal counts.,"right"
Biden didn’t work as trucker,"right"
President Joe Biden has been on the campaign trail and on Tuesday he stopped at Hillsborough Community College in Tampa, Florida.,"right"
Biden answered, “Well, we did get that done.,"right"
During a 2021 tour of a Mack Trucks facility, Biden told the crowd, “I used to drive an 18-wheeler, man.” And while talking to college students studying truck technology during a different event that year, he said, “I used to drive a tractor-trailer.,"right"
But there is no evidence Biden ever drove an 18-wheeler, CNN said.,"right"
When the news organization inquired in 2021, The White House told CNN that Biden at one time had a part-time job driving a school bus, which is not an 18-wheeler, and as a senator in 1973, he rode in, but did not drive, a cargo truck.,"right"
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - Iran's president-elect staked out a hard-line position Monday in his first remarks since his landslide election victory, rejecting the possibility of meeting with President Joe Biden or negotiating Tehran's ballistic missile program and support of regional militias.,"right"
But he ruled out any limits to Iran's missile capabilities and support for regional militias - among other issues viewed by Washington as shortcomings of the landmark deal that the Biden administration wants addressed.,"right"
When asked about a possible meeting with Biden, Raisi curtly answered: 'œNo.'ť He frowned and stared ahead, without elaborating.,"right"
His moderate competitor in the election, Abdolnasser Hemmati, had suggested during campaigning that he might be willing to meet Biden.,"right"
She added that Biden views Iran's 'œdecision leader is the supreme leader.,"right"
In a remarkable tableau, President Joe Biden, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris stood together at ground zero just hours after Trump and Harris faced off in their first debate.,"right"
Trump and Biden — the successor whose inauguration Trump skipped — shook hands, and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg appeared to facilitate a handshake between Harris and Trump.,"right"
Then the presidential rivals stood only a few feet apart, Biden and Bloomberg between them, as the observance began with the tolling of a bell and a moment of silence.,"right"
Biden, on his last Sept.,"right"
Biden and Harris spoke with victims’ relatives and visited the local fire department; Trump and Vance went to a New York City firehouse earlier in the day.,"right"
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) - A close ally of Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro said Friday he's hopeful the Biden administration will roll back a 'œcruel'ť sanctions policy and instead give room for diplomacy that could lead to the reopening of the U.S. Embassy and the release of several jailed American citizens.,"right"
It's unclear if the Biden administration will accept the overture or continue with the hardline policy of regime change it inherits.,"right"
In his new job he's expected to remain at the forefront of bitter relations with the United States as President-elect Joe Biden takes office and charts his own foreign policy.,"right"
Analysts say Biden has limited options to undo crippling oil sanctions imposed as part of Trump's 'œmaximum pressure'ť campaign.,"right"
But reaching that goal requires buy-in from Biden.,"right"
Biden's transition team declined to comment.,"right"
— Speaking at a conference on gun violence a dozen miles from the scene of the Connecticut school massacre, Vice President Joe Biden tried to rally support Thursday for the Obama administration’s gun control proposals.,"right"
Biden said the Dec.,"right"
“America has changed on this issue,” Biden said.,"right"
Biden advocated a series of proposals, including universal background checks for gun owners, a ban on many military-style weapons and a limit on the size of magazines.,"right"
“Fewer children will die,” Biden said.,"right"
On the Democratic side, President Joe Biden is seeking reelection as the high inflation that defined much of his first term appears to be easing.,"right"
And at least three serious candidates who have launched outsider presidential bids threaten to scramble the campaign and eat into the support from independent voters who were critical to Biden's success in 2020.,"right"
Jim Messina, who managed former President Barack Obama’s reelection, said Trump could very well defeat Biden in the fall, even if the former president is in prison.,"right"
Domestic politics could also test Biden's commitment to Israel, a policy that threatens to erode his standing with young voters and people of color who are critical elements of his coalition.,"right"
One of the few certainties at this point is that Biden is a virtual lock to be the Democratic nominee again, facing only token opposition in this year's primary despite overwhelming concerns within his own party about his physical and mental fitness.,"right"
Biden vs.,"right"
Public polling strongly suggests that voters do not want a rematch between Trump and Biden.,"right"
Most U.S. adults overall (56%) would be “very” or “somewhat” dissatisfied with Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee in 2024, according to a poll conducted last month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.,"right"
Perhaps because of such apathy, some voters simply don’t believe Biden and Trump will end up on the general election ballot, despite strong evidence to the contrary.,"right"
Biden,” Longwell said.,"right"
While concerns about Biden are centered on his age, Trump has increasingly embraced authoritarian messages that serve as clear warnings of his plans to dismantle democratic norms if he returns to the White House.,"right"
Biden, like his party more broadly, has leaned into concerns about the future of democracy should Trump return to the White House, but that has done little to improve his standing.,"right"
People on Biden's team do not fear that his base will defect to Trump in the general election, but they privately worry some of the Democratic president's supporters may not vote at all.,"right"
They're betting that Biden's achievements, which include landmark legislation on gun control, climate change and infrastructure, will eventually help overcome pervasive concerns about his age.,"right"
Ultimately, however, Biden's campaign believes that voters will rally behind the president once they fully understand that Trump could realistically return to the White House.,"right"
Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, who sits on Biden's advisory council, said the president's reelection campaign “knows it can't take any vote for granted," which is why the campaign has already invested heavily in efforts to mobilize Biden's diverse coalition.,"right"
Martell said he doubts the 2024 election will ultimately be a rematch of Trump and Biden, however: “Honestly, if it comes to that kind of race again, I think it could get pretty ugly.","right"
She isn't convinced that Biden and Trump will emerge as their party's nominees, either.,"right"
WASHINGTON - A violent mob loyal to President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday and forced lawmakers into hiding, in a stunning attempt to overturn America's presidential election, undercut the nation's democracy and keep Democrat Joe Biden from replacing Trump in the White House.,"right"
The rioters were egged on by Trump, who has spent weeks falsely attacking the integrity of the election  and had urged his supporters to descend on Washington to protest Congress' formal approval of Biden's victory.,"right"
Though the efforts to block Biden from being sworn in on Jan.,"right"
Congress reconvened in the evening, lawmakers decrying the protests that defaced the Capitol and vowing to finish confirming the Electoral College vote for Biden's election, even if it took all night.,"right"
Before dawn Thursday, lawmakers completed their work, confirming Biden won the presidential election.,"right"
A somber  President-elect Biden, two weeks away from being inaugurated, said American democracy was "under unprecedented assault, " a sentiment echoed by many in Congress, including some Republicans.,"right"
Tensions were already running high when lawmakers gathered early Wednesday afternoon for the constitutionally mandated counting of the Electoral College results, in which Biden defeated Trump, 306-232.,"right"
But Pence, in a statement shortly before presiding, defied Trump, saying he could not claim "unilateral authority" to reject the electoral votes that make Biden president.,"right"

HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) - President Joe Biden tried to reassure world leaders on Saturday that the United States would not default as he consulted with the heads of Australia, Japan and India in a meeting of the so-called Quad partnership that had been hastily rescheduled because of the debt limit standoff back in Washington.,"right"
Hoping to avert an outcome that would rattle the global economy and prove to be a boon to Beijing, Biden opened his third day in Japan at the annual Group of Seven meeting of the world's most powerful democracies with a briefing from his staff on the latest fits and starts in talks over how to raise the federal debt limit.,"right"
The Quad members originally had planned to meet in Sydney next week, but got together instead on the sidelines of the G7 so Biden could return to Washington earlier on Sunday in hopes of finalizing a deal to increase the U.S. borrowing limit before the government runs out of cash to pay its bills.,"right"
Biden said he felt there was headway in the talks with GOP lawmakers.,"right"
The shortened trip has reinforced a fundamental tension shaping Biden's presidency: As he has worked to signal to the world that the U.S. is reclaiming the mantle of global leadership, at key moments, domestic dramas keep getting in the way.,"right"
Until Saturday, Biden had largely stayed out of the public eye at the summit, forgoing big public statements and leaving Friday's leader dinner early.,"right"
National security adviser Jake Sullivan acknowledged that world leaders have pressed Biden about the standoff in Washington.,"right"
On the margins of the summit, Biden held talks with Albanese in lieu of the now-scrapped visit to Australia.,"right"
U.S. officials said the trip would be rescheduled, and Biden has invited Albanese to Washington for a state visit.,"right"
Biden apologized for skipping Australia.,"right"
"I would have done exactly the same thing," he told Biden, adding, "I'm very much looking forward to the state visit.","right"
Biden said the U.S. has mobilized more than $30 billion in investments to date "and we're just getting started.","right"
During a full meeting in the evening with all of the Quad leaders, Biden repeated his apologies about needing to move their gathering to Japan.,"right"
That presidential stop, too, was scrapped in order to get Biden back to Washington more quickly.,"right"
Biden's visit would have been the first by an American president to the country.,"right"
In Hiroshima, Biden and other world leaders agreed on a shared framework for improving their own economic resilience - a recognition that high levels of trade with China have become more of a risk than an opportunity for mature economies.,"right"
Biden and first lady Jill Biden attended a dinner Saturday for G7 leaders and other officials who participated in the summit.,"right"
President Joe Biden, while campaigning in Pennsylvania last month, made a stop at a Sheetz gas station and convenience store to pick up sandwiches for construction workers at Pittsburgh International Airport.,"right"
Biden, accompanied by Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey, was on his way out of town following a speech at the United Steelworkers’ headquarters in Pittsburgh.,"right"
“Biden tries copying Trump by visiting a gas station in PA - instead he's ignored by virtually everyone there,” Fox News host Sean Hannity wrote the next day in a Facebook post which included a clip from the event.,"right"
But this post is not accurate, according to PolitiFact, and the video shared by Hannity “does not corroborate his own claim about Biden being ignored.”,"right"
The clip Hannity posted, which was published by C-SPAN, shows Biden interacting and joking with children as he enters the store.,"right"
In a different video posted by CBS News, Biden is seen being greeted by a man who gives him a hug and then poses with the president for a photo taken by Gainey.,"right"
In another post of the C-SPAN video from Biden’s stop, someone can be heard yelling profanity at the president.,"right"
(Expletive),” a voice on the five-second clip says as Biden walks through the convenience store.,"right"
As my mother and I watched President Joe Biden speak to the nation after announcing that he would not be running for reelection, my mother brought up one of my funny childhood moments when Gerald Ford was president.,"right"
This humorous memory lightened the mood as my mother and I were thinking about the historical impact of Biden dropping out of the presidential race roughly four months before we all head to the polls.,"right"
While listening to Biden discuss his legacy and share his remaining agenda as he finishes out what will be his first and only term as president, it was very apparent that he had gotten some much-needed rest while recovering from COVID.,"right"
I had expected Biden to mention his health, but he did not, even though his physical and mental stamina was pretty much on everyone's minds.,"right"
Looking at Biden now, he has significantly declined physically since he was campaigning for president in 2019.,"right"
In Biden's case, I think the legal woes of his son Hunter added a heavy emotional burden to carry.,"right"
The federal probe into Hunter's taxes and his business dealings with China continued into his father's first year in office and caused a torrent of political criticism and scrutiny for the Biden family.,"right"
Biden was 78 in 2021 at the beginning of his term, and in navigating his way to lead the country through the pandemic, he had to deal with the global crisis of Russia invading Ukraine two years later.,"right"
I know this is the job Biden signed up for.,"right"
There's no way Biden could bear this personal load at his age now and endure what is going to be a hot-blooded and attack-laden campaign battle up until November.,"right"
In his speech on why he dropped out of the '24 race, Biden said that "[w]e are a nation of promise and possibilities, of dreamers and doers, of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things.” This is undoubtedly true, but sadly, we are also a nation that is greatly lacking in compassion for one another due to how we have allowed differing political views to polarize us.,"right"
Toward the end of his address, Biden stated that in giving his “heart and soul to our nation” that he had “been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people.” However, it's probably safe to assume that this love and support has come mostly from his ardent supporters.,"right"
Regarding a politician and public figure like Biden, criticism of domestic and foreign policy stances is warranted along with disapproval of bad personal decisions.,"right"
As Biden prepares to step away from over 50 years of public service, my compassionate prayer is that he will find the peace of God that “reassures the heart … [and] transcends all understanding.” Peace from turmoil and bickering.,"right"
— Jurors in Hunter Biden’s gun trial began deliberating Monday whether the president’s son is guilty of federal firearms charges over a revolver he bought in 2018 when prosecutors say he was addicted to crack cocaine.,"right"
Prosecutors have used testimony from former romantic partners, personal text messages and photos of Hunter Biden with drug paraphernalia or partially clothed to make the case that he broke the law.,"right"
“No one is above the law,” prosecutor Leo Wise told jurors in his closing argument as first lady Jill Biden watched from the front row of the Wilmington, Delaware, courtroom.,"right"
President Joe Biden's son has publicly detailed his struggle with a crack cocaine addiction before getting sober more than five years ago.,"right"
The case has pitted Hunter Biden against his father's Justice Department in the midst of the Democratic president's reelection campaign.,"right"
Before the case went to the jury, the prosecutor urged jurors to focus on the “overwhelming” evidence against Hunter Biden and pay no mind to members of the president's family sitting in the courtroom.,"right"
Jill Biden and other family members left the courthouse shortly after deliberations began.,"right"
At one point Monday, Hunter Biden leaned over a railing to whisper in his mother’s ear.,"right"
Hunter Biden's lawyers have suggested he was trying to turn his life around at the time of the gun purchase, having completed a detoxification and rehabilitation program at the end of August 2018.,"right"
Closing arguments came shortly after the defense rested its case without calling Hunter Biden to the witness stand.,"right"
The trial has put a spotlight on a turbulent time in Hunter Biden's life after the 2015 death of his brother, Beau, from brain cancer.,"right"
The proceedings have played out in the president’s home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established.,"right"
Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington, and Beau Biden was the state's attorney general.,"right"
Hunter Biden's ex-wife and two former girlfriends testified for prosecutors about his habitual crack use and their failed efforts to help him get clean.,"right"
One woman, who met Hunter Biden in 2017 at a strip club where she worked, described him smoking crack every 20 minutes or so while she stayed with him at a hotel.,"right"
Joe Biden said last week that he would accept the jury’s verdict and ruled out a presidential pardon for his son.,"right"
Last summer, it looked as if Hunter Biden would avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether, but a deal with prosecutors imploded after the judge, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, raised concerns about it.,"right"
Hunter Biden also faces a trial scheduled for September on felony charges alleging he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years.,"right"
President Biden has acknowledged its ratification but passed the buck to a polarized Congress.,"right"
President Biden has the power to instruct the U.S. Archivist to certify and publish the amendment, making equal rights the law of the land.,"right"
With less than two months left in office, the League of Women Voters of Roselle-Bloomingdale calls upon President Biden to pick up the phone and instruct the Archivist to finalize the ERA now.,"right"
President Joe Biden told NBC News in an interview Monday that it was a “mistake” to say he wanted to put a “bull's-eye” on Republican nominee Donald Trump, but argued that the rhetoric from his opponent was more incendiary while warning that Trump remained a threat to democratic institutions.,"right"
Those remarks from Biden came during a private call with donors last week as the Democrat had been scrambling to shore up his imperiled candidacy with key party constituencies.,"right"
During that conversation, Biden declared that he was “done” talking about his poor debate performance and that it was “time to put Trump in the bull's-eye,” saying Trump has gotten far too little scrutiny on his stances, rhetoric and lack of campaigning.,"right"
The NBC interview came as Biden and his reelection team prepared to resume full-throttle campaigning after a brief pause following the weekend assassination attempt on Trump.,"right"
“He’s a clone of Trump on the issues,” Biden told reporters as he headed to Nevada for a series of speeches and campaign events.,"right"
Once Vance was tapped as Trump’s vice-presidential pick, the Biden campaign hit send on a fundraising solicitation signed by the president, and his team issued a blistering statement, saying he picked the freshman senator because he would “bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda.” For her part, Vice President Kamala Harris phoned Vance to congratulate him and left him a voicemail message, according to a person familiar with the matter.,"right"
And to NBC anchor Lester Holt, Biden made it clear that he would keep up his focus on Trump.,"right"
While he acknowledged his “mistake,” Biden nonetheless said he is “not the guy who said I wanted to be a dictator on Day One” and that he wanted the focus to be on what Trump was saying.,"right"
It's Trump, not Biden, who engages in that kind of rhetoric, Biden said, referring to Trump’s past comments about a “bloodbath” if the Republican loses to Biden in November.,"right"
“Look, how do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real, when a president says things like he says?” Biden said.,"right"
The NBC interview, scheduled before the attempt on Trump’s life at a rally in Pennsylvania, had been part of Biden’s broader strategy to prove his fitness for office after angst grew among Democrats because of his disastrous June 27 debate performance.,"right"
The Biden campaign recalibrated some of its political plans in the immediate aftermath of the assassination attempt on Saturday, pulling advertising off the air and hitting pause on messaging.,"right"
The White House also scrapped Biden’s planned Monday visit to the Lyndon B.,"right"
Biden also spoke privately to Trump after the assassination attempt, a call that the president described in the NBC interview as “very cordial.”,"right"
“I told him how concerned I was and wanted to make sure I knew how he was actually doing,” Biden said.,"right"
It’s still not finalized when Biden’s campaign ads will resume airing.,"right"
But Biden is pressing on with the Nevada portion of his previously scheduled western swing, which will include remarks to the NAACP and UnidosUS, a Latino civil rights and advocacy group.,"right"
Biden has acknowledged that his candidacy and agenda will be under attack at the Republican National Convention this week, and aides had felt no need to halt their campaign completely, particularly while Biden comes under scrutiny in Milwaukee.,"right"
Asked whether Biden would adjust his messaging this week in light of the assassination attempt, O'Malley Dillon pointed to his Oval Office address as a “roadmap for the whole country,” which she said was no different from Biden's broader message from the start of his candidacy.,"right"
Biden’s renewed campaigning this week comes as Democrats have been at an impasse over whether the incumbent president should continue in the race even as he was defiant that he would stay in.,"right"
Biden has made it clear in no uncertain terms that he remains in the race, and aides have been operating as such.,"right"
It was unclear if the attempt on Trump’s life would blunt Democratic efforts to urge Biden to step aside, but it appears to have stalled some of the momentum, for now.,"right"
In the hours before the shooting, Biden was still being confronted by frustration and skepticism from Democratic lawmakers.,"right"
Jared Huffman of California said he asked the president during his meeting with the Congressional Progressive Caucus about objectively assessing the trajectory of the race, and if the Lord almighty doesn’t intervene would Biden consider “the best earthly alternative”: meeting with former Presidents Obama and Clinton, Democratic leadership including Rep.,"right"
Huffman said on a social media post that Biden “disagreed with the notion that we are on a losing trajectory.”,"right"
And while Biden expressed a “willingness to listen” to other voices, Huffman said he doubted any would be persuasive.,"right"
But now, several Democrats who requested anonymity were skeptical that there would be enough drive among lawmakers to successfully try to pressure Biden not to run, especially because they are scattered and away from Washington until next week and because Biden has said he won’t step aside and seized the opportunity to quickly respond to the shooting over the weekend.,"right"
Asked by Holt if he has weathered the worst of it from his own party, Biden responded that 14 million Democratic voters selected him through the primaries and added, “I listen to them.” His mental acuity is “pretty damn good,” Biden added, but he said the question of his age was “legitimate” to ask.,"right"
Jeffries met with Biden at the White House on Thursday night, while Schumer went to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on Saturday for his visit with Biden, which occurred just before the assassination attempt on Trump.,"right"
There were still deep concerns that Biden is not up to the job and a sense that pressure to try and find another candidate could ramp up again when lawmakers return to Washington.,"right"
Congressional Democrats were watching the Republican National Convention and Biden’s appearances this week with awareness that the dynamics could change — again.,"right"
WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump made a victor’s return to Washington on Wednesday, visiting the White House for an Oval Office meeting with President Joe Biden and committing to a smooth transition of power as the president-elect moves quickly to build out his new administration.,"right"
Biden called Trump "Mr. President-elect and former president” before settling on “Donald.”,"right"
“I look forward to having, like they said, a smooth transition,” Biden said.,"right"
At one point, Biden looked at Trump, who moved his head to the side and gave a small shrug but did not respond.,"right"
Each was joined by his chief of staff for the private meeting that is a traditional part of the peaceful handoff of power, but a ritual that Trump declined to participate in four years ago after losing to Biden.,"right"
First lady Jill Biden greeted Trump upon his arrival at the White House and gave him a handwritten letter of congratulations for his wife, Melania Trump, who did not make the trip to Washington.,"right"
As Trump met with Biden, Trump sent out a fundraising email to supporters saying that he "is inside the White House right now conducting a very important meeting.”,"right"
The private meetings, including his sit-down with Biden, put in stark relief the former president’s remarkable political rebound.,"right"
Musk joining Trump on the return to Washington comes after the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has been spending much of his time at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Florida estate, and participating in discussions as the incoming Trump administration prepares to transition from Biden's.,"right"
Four years later, Trump disputed his election loss to Biden, and he has continued to lie about widespread voter fraud that did not occur.,"right"
He didn't invite Biden, then the president-elect, to the White House and he left Washington without attending Biden's inauguration.,"right"
Biden insists that he'll do everything he can to make the transition to the next Trump administration go smoothly.,"right"
Biden then bowed out of the race in July and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him.,"right"
When Trump left Washington in 2021, even some top Republicans had begun to decry his role in helping incite a mob of his supporters that had staged the violent attack on the Capitol mere weeks earlier, trying to stop the certification of Biden’s election victory.,"right"
Abbot of Texas has seen thousands of undocumented immigrants cross the southern border unchecked by the Biden administration.,"right"
WASHINGTON — Joe Biden's tribulations were previewed in Hollywood days before he got on the debate stage.,"right"
At a fundraiser organized by George Clooney and packed with luminaries including former President Barack Obama, Biden was a listless figure, perhaps merely jet-lagged after flying straight from Italy but clearly not the man they knew.,"right"
Then came the debate debacle, which set off 50 shades of panic among Democrats and pitted Biden loyalists against those now convinced a successor should take the party into November.,"right"
Many more kept their newfound alarm about Biden semiprivate.,"right"
The bleeding of support continued past Biden's NATO news conference Thursday night.,"right"
Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, posted on X that Biden should step aside.,"right"
Lawmakers were furious that the White House kept Biden in such a bubble for so long that Americans could be blindsided by how bad he was on the stage with Trump.,"right"
Biden’s camp was furious at the public show of disloyalty by those who want him replaced on the ticket and the relentless focus on Biden’s every word and step.,"right"
Most stayed with Biden over those two weeks as dissent alternately flared, faded and sparked anew, like tamped-down embers in a dry forest.,"right"
Democrats on both sides of the Biden divide were left fearing the prospects of a Donald Trump win.,"right"
Biden was befogged from the first words he uttered, or muttered.,"right"
Voters had long felt Biden, now 81, was too old to be effective but they had never seen him like this.,"right"
Biden hadn't been on his game for some time before June 27.,"right"
After the long flight from Europe, Biden was unable to turn it on for his 30-minute onstage conversation with late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel and Obama at the June 15 fundraiser.,"right"
It's not often a popular former president and the brightest Hollywood stars join to rally behind a candidate, and donors and other Democrats hoped the event would get Biden's motor running.,"right"
“It is devastating to say so,” Clooney wrote in The New York Times this week, but the event convinced him that Biden, a man he loves, should go: “He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.”,"right"
The White House, in the first of its shifting explanations for Biden's troubling demeanor, said he was sick with a cold or the like when going into the debate.,"right"
(The White House initially said Biden did not see a doctor, then said he had.,"right"
Its explanation for Biden's frailty evolved to jet lag.),"right"
The debate left even some of Biden's aides questioning privately whether his campaign could be salvaged.,"right"
Some longtime Biden supporters called immediately for him to step aside.,"right"
The morning after the debate, the illness cited by Biden's people seemed to have disappeared.,"right"
The most prominent Democrats talked up the past — Biden's accomplishments — and the strength of the team supporting the president.,"right"
In an early sign of trouble, one Democratic senator did not presume that Biden would hang in for the election.,"right"
That weekend, the Biden campaign emailed supporters about a “flash poll” purporting to show that Biden was best positioned among potential replacements to defeat Trump.,"right"
Actually, like other public polls, it showed no clear advantage for Biden over other possible candidates.,"right"
Other public polling released in the immediate aftermath of the debate found that most watchers thought Trump outperformed Biden, although neither candidate’s favorability ratings shifted meaningfully.,"right"
In the email, deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty branded the Biden doubters the “bed-wetting brigade.” More sheets were about to be soiled.,"right"
Five months after a stroke, Fetterman was hopelessly muddled against his sprightly Republican opponent, Mehmet Oz. As with Biden, Fetterman's people wondered why the candidate, on a long road to recovery, had ever agreed to go on that stage just days before the 2022 midterms.,"right"
With no chance of recovering from being 81 to 85 in the next four years, Biden saw the cracks in his support widen, but, crucially, Democrats as a whole did not rush to judgment.,"right"
Old as he may be, Biden has had time on his side in this late-in-the-game crisis.,"right"
But on July 2, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi lent credence to the doubts about Biden, saying she was hearing mixed opinions on whether he should stay.,"right"
Lloyd Doggett of Texas became the first lawmaker to say Biden should go.,"right"
For days, Democrats had been imploring Biden to get out more, call more lawmakers and put himself in unscripted situations to show what he can do.,"right"
Nanette Barragan of California, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and a Biden supporter.,"right"
Biden’s dilemma was clear.,"right"
But first, as scattered defections were picking up, Biden spoke in person and remotely in a closed session with Democratic governors.,"right"
Wes Moore, firmly behind Biden, called it a “bitch session” by unnerved governors.,"right"
In large measure, governors came away sounding supportive of Biden or at least quiet about discontent, and reported that he seemed on top of things.,"right"
Yet the session played into public perceptions of Biden as stretched thin, as he acknowledged he needs to get more sleep and limit evening events so he can go to bed earlier.,"right"
In 22 minutes with Stephanopoulos on July 5, Biden avoided another debacle like his debate — a matchup that had been proposed by his campaign and accepted by Trump's.,"right"
Biden's ill-timed pauses, meandering moments and garbled words made some even more alarmed than they were before, because now the debate could not be written off as just one bad night.,"right"
Biden, he said, is “dangerously out-of-touch with the concerns people have about his capacities moving forward and his standing in this race.”,"right"
Rob Reiner, the Hollywood director, Democratic Party donor and “Meathead” of long-ago “All in the Family” fame, posted an expletive on X with his opinion that “It’s time for Joe Biden to step down.”,"right"
Michael Moore, the Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker who forecast Trump's 2016 victory when most others on the left (and the right and the center) figured he would lose, appealed to Biden to not “let your enablers hound you into doing what your body is begging you not to do.”,"right"
Among governors, those who have been floated as presidential prospects voiced firm support for Biden, surely in part to avoid being seen as pretenders to the throne.,"right"
Andy Beshear told a news conference Thursday, “I support him as long as he is our nominee” but the Biden campaign needs to set “an aggressive campaign schedule” and provide “the information on his health that I think people have been asking for.”,"right"
For all that, the debate among Democrats over what to do in the aftermath of June 27 has been most pronounced in Congress, where Biden made career-long friendships in his decades as a senator.,"right"
It’s the place where Biden, as president, has scored improbable wins for some of the top items on his agenda.,"right"
In inconclusive Capitol Hill meetings this week, more Democrats spoke up for Biden than against him, even as many suggested the private feelings were moving swiftly away from the president.,"right"
On Monday, Biden sent a forceful open letter to congressional Democrats declaring: “Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us.,"right"
With Biden's allies stepping up pressure, the ground appeared to shift again, this time in his favor.,"right"
Her words were exquisitely measured but instantly taken as a setback for Biden.,"right"
Days earlier, Biden had vowed only the “Lord Almighty” would make him quit.,"right"
Peter Welch of Vermont became the first senator to call openly for Biden to quit the campaign.,"right"
“President Biden must seriously consider the best way to preserve his incredible legacy and secure it for the future.”,"right"
Mark Warner, who took steps early on to bring colleagues together to assess the damage from the debate, said Biden needed to burst out of his protective bubble and “hear directly from a broader group of voices.”,"right"
Earl Blumenauer, the longest serving Democrat in Oregon’s House delegation, became the ninth House Democrat to ask Biden to step aside, followed Thursday by more.,"right"
They have given voice to many more who have said, whether publicly or privately, that Biden puts Democrats on a path to defeat.,"right"
Adam Schiff of California, while stopping short of urging Biden to quit the campaign, said people are rightfully asking whether the president has the vigor to defeat Trump.,"right"
NEW YORK — Republican former congressman Adam Kinzinger endorsed President Joe Biden on Wednesday, giving the Democrat a prominent new ally in his high-stakes campaign to win over moderate Republicans and independents this fall.,"right"
Kinzinger, a military pilot who emerged as a fierce critic of former President Donald Trump after the U.S. Capitol was attacked by Trump's supporters, described Trump as “a direct threat to every fundamental American value” in a video announcing the Biden endorsement.,"right"
“While I certainly don’t agree with President Biden on everything, and I never thought I’d be endorsing a Democrat for president, I know that he will always protect the very thing that makes America the best country in the world: our democracy,” said Kinzinger, who voted for Trump in 2020.,"right"
Kinzinger's announcement comes on the eve of the opening presidential debate and gives Biden an example he can raise Thursday night of a well-known Republican supporting him over Trump.,"right"
Biden’s camp is prioritizing outreach to moderate Republicans and independents alienated by Trump’s tumultuous White House tenure.,"right"
Kinzinger becomes the highest-profile Republican official formally backing Biden, whose campaign earlier in the month tapped Kinzinger's former chief of staff Austin Weatherford to serve as its national Republican outreach director.,"right"
Geoff Duncan also endorsed Biden last month.,"right"
Ultimately, a number of prominent Republicans are expected to join Biden's campaign, with more influential names likely to be announced closer to the November election.,"right"
Shortly after Kinzinger announced his decision, Biden shared the endorsement video on social media and said he was grateful for the Republican's support.,"right"
“This is what putting your country before your party looks like,” Biden wrote on X.,"right"
Biden's team is trying to create what it calls “a permission structure” for Republican voters who would otherwise have a difficult time casting a ballot for the Democratic president.,"right"
The committee highlighted a number of Trump's transgressions before and during the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol as Congress tried to certify the election results for Biden.,"right"
“Now is the time to unite behind Joe Biden and show Donald Trump off the stage once and for all.”,"right"
In a statement Wednesday, Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez described Kinzinger as “a true public servant who is a model for putting our country and our democracy over party and blind acquiescence to Trump.”,"right"
“Those Americans have a home in President Biden’s coalition, and our campaign knows that we need to show up and earn their support.”,"right"
Biden has been particularly focused on courting supporters of Republican former presidential candidate Nikki Haley, who continued to win over a significant number of anti-Trump GOP primary voters throughout the spring even after suspending her campaign.,"right"
As part of Biden’s sustained outreach to moderate voters in both parties, his campaign released an ad highlighting Trump’s often-personal attacks against Haley, including his primary nickname of her as “birdbrain” and suggestion that “she’s not presidential timber.”,"right"
WASHINGTON — The Senate on Wednesday confirmed the 200th federal judge of President Joe Biden's tenure, about a month earlier than when Donald Trump hit that mark in his term, though Trump still holds the edge when it comes to the most impactful confirmations — those to the Supreme Court and the country's 13 appellate courts.,"right"
The milestone reflects the importance that Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., placed on judicial confirmations after Trump put his enormous stamp on the federal judiciary with the confirmation of three Supreme Court justices.,"right"
The current pace of judicial confirmations for this White House came despite Biden, a Democrat, coming into office in 2021 with far fewer vacancies, particularly in the influential appellate courts, than Trump, a Republican, did in 2017.,"right"
“There is more work to do,” Biden said in a statement after the vote.,"right"
It's unclear whether Biden can eclipse his predecessor's 234 judges before the year ends, though.,"right"
Biden has tapped one Supreme Court justice and 42 appellate court judges.,"right"
Biden has more confirmations of the district judges who handle civil and criminal cases.,"right"
Biden has emphasized adding more female and minority judges to the federal bench.,"right"
In the appellate courts, 30 of the 42 circuit judges confirmed during Biden's term are women, according to the White House.,"right"
Under Biden, more Hispanic judges have been confirmed to the appellate courts than any other administration.,"right"
As abortion access remains a vital priority for the Biden administration and a key argument for the president's reelection bid, the White House also points to several judges with backgrounds on the issue.,"right"
Asked about the diversity of Biden's nominees, GOP senators said there was too much focus on “identity politics.”,"right"
One of the two Republicans running for Illinois' 5th Congressional District seat denies that Joe Biden fairly won the presidency in 2020.,"right"
The Daily Herald used a candidate questionnaire to ask Hanson and McGonigal if they thought Biden's victory over Trump was legitimate and fair.,"right"
Hanson said the question alone indicates Biden's win "was not fair and just.","right"
Still, Hanson acknowledged Biden is the president, "regardless of whether it was fair or not.","right"
SAN FRANCISCO - President Joe Biden and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, two strong allies who don't always get along personally, will talk migration, fentanyl trafficking and Cuba relations on Friday.,"right"
The two leaders are in San Francisco for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, where Biden has held a series of face-to-face meetings with other leaders, including China's President Xi Jinping and the leaders of Japan and South Korea, as he seeks to reassure the region that the U.S. and China are competitors, not zero-sum rivals.,"right"
Biden's relationship with López Obrador is at times tense, in part because of Biden's willingness to criticize Mexico on topics such as fentanyl production and the killing of journalists.,"right"
López Obrador said he would use Friday's meeting with Biden to take up the case for Cuba and would urge his U.S. counterpart to resume a dialogue with the island nation and end U.S. sanctions.,"right"
Biden, meanwhile, was expected to bring up migration as the U.S. continues to manage a growing number of southern border crossings.,"right"
The leaders also are expected to discuss deadly fentanyl trafficking, particularly after Biden secured an agreement with Xi to curb the illicit opioid.,"right"
Republicans are loudly critical of Biden's border policies as too lax.,"right"
Biden asked for $14 billion from Congress for border security but the temporary spending bill he signed did not have funding for the border, Ukraine aid or Israel.,"right"
Arrests for illegal crossings along the U.S.-Mexico line were up 21% to 218,763 in September, and Biden has repeatedly said Congress should act to fix outdated immigration laws.,"right"
The giggling toddlers and energetic dancers who normally would occupy Vernon Hills' Sullivan Community Center on Wednesday will make way for a political rally featuring Vice President Joe Biden.,"right"
Biden is coming to the center on Aspen Drive in the afternoon to stump for some fellow Democrats on the Nov.,"right"
Park district Executive Director Jeff Fougerousse sounded excited about Biden's visit.,"right"
The Sullivan Center was chosen for Biden's visit because it's in the 10th Congressional District, where Democratic incumbent Brad Schneider is running a close race with Republican rival Robert Dold.,"right"
Biden and Schneider will be joined by U.S. Sen.,"right"
Biden's visit isn't causing any other significant disruptions in town, officials said.,"right"
The Secret Service will handle Biden's transportation, officials said.,"right"
Hundreds fill Vernon Hills gym for Biden,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are poised to move much closer to winning their parties' nominations Tuesday during the biggest day of the primary campaign, despite many voters preferring something other than a November rematch from four years ago.,"right"
The spotlight, however, remains on the 81-year-old Biden and the 77-year-old Trump, who continue to dominate their parties despite both facing questions about their age and neither commanding broad popularity across the general electorate.,"right"
The earliest either can become his party’s presumptive nominee is March 12 for Trump and March 19 for Biden.,"right"
But in a departure from most previous Super Tuesdays, both nominations are effectively settled, with Biden and Trump both looking ahead to a reprise of the 2020 general election.,"right"
“We have to beat Biden — he is the worst president in history,” Trump said Tuesday on the Fox & Friends cable morning show.,"right"
Biden countered with a pair of radio interviews aimed at shoring up his support among Black voters, who helped anchor his 2020 coalition.,"right"
“If we lose this election, you’re going to be back with Donald Trump,” Biden said on “DeDe in the Morning” hosted by DeDe McGuire.,"right"
Despite Biden's and Trump's domination of their parties, polls make it clear that the broader electorate does not want this year’s general election to be identical to the 2020 race.,"right"
A new AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll finds a majority of Americans don't think either Biden or Trump has the necessary mental acuity for the job.,"right"
Rather than barnstorming the states holding primaries, Biden and Trump held rival events last week along the U.S.-Mexico border, each seeking to gain an advantage in the increasingly fraught immigration debate.,"right"
After the Supreme Court ruled 9-0 on Monday to restore Trump to primary ballots following attempts to ban him for his role in helping spark the Capitol riot, Trump pointed to the 91 criminal counts against him to accuse Biden of weaponizing the courts.,"right"
Biden delivers the State of the Union address Thursday, then will campaign in the key swing states of Pennsylvania and Georgia.,"right"
Biden’s campaign called attention to Trump’s most provocative statements that evoked Adolf Hitler by declaring that immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of the U.S. and suggesting flippantly that he would serve as a dictator on his first day back in the White House.,"right"
Haley has hopscotched across the country, visiting at least one Super Tuesday state almost daily for more than a week suggesting Trump cannot defeat Biden.,"right"
Biden has his own problems, including low approval ratings and polls suggesting that many Americans, even a majority of Democrats, don’t want to see the 81-year-old running again.,"right"
Tim Walz, a Biden ally, told The Associated Press last week that he expected some votes for “uncommitted” on Tuesday.,"right"
Biden is the oldest president ever and Republicans key on any verbal slip he makes.,"right"
His aides insist that skeptical voters will come around once it is clear that either Trump or Biden will be elected again in November.,"right"
Trump is now the same age Biden was during the 2020 campaign, and he has exacerbated questions about his own fitness with recent flubs, such as mistakenly suggesting he was running against Barack Obama, who left the White House in 2017.,"right"
“I would love to see the next generation move up and take leadership roles,” said Democrat Susan Steele, 71, who voted Tuesday for Biden in Portland, Maine.,"right"
Mary Veroneau, a 69-year-old old Maine Democrat, also voted for Biden but said “you'd honestly want a younger candidate” than either the president or the former president.,"right"
“Trump would eat him up,” Ken Ballos, a retired police officer who attended a weekend Trump rally in Virginia, adding that Biden “would look like a fool up there.”,"right"
Many dignitaries were on hand to escort President Joe Biden on stage at an appearance Thursday in Elk Grove Village.,"right"
Wenzel, a senior field operations manager for construction and engineering firm Clayco, already had been advising the U.S. Secret Service in advance of Biden's visit.,"right"
The firm is building a data center for Microsoft in Elk Grove Village's Technology Park, and the White House chose that setting for Biden to promote employer COVID-19 vaccine requirements, which Clayco endorses.,"right"
“President Biden wants to be introduced by a union tradesman from Clayco.,"right"
“We're thrilled you're all here,” Wenzel said with Biden waiting at his side.,"right"
“Thank you for making the safety of our workforce your top priority,” he told Biden.,"right"

President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday formally lowered the threshold for Russia’s use of its nuclear weapons, a move that follows U.S. President Joe Biden’s decision to let Ukraine strike targets inside Russian territory with American-supplied longer-range missiles.,"right"
Commenting on whether the updated doctrine was deliberately issued to follow Biden’s decision, Peskov said the document was published “in a timely manner” and that Putin instructed the government to update it earlier this year so that it is “in line with the current situation.”,"right"
WASHINGTON — A fundraiser for President Joe Biden on Thursday in New York City that also stars Barack Obama and Bill Clinton is raising a whopping $25 million, setting a record for the biggest haul for a political event, his campaign said.,"right"
The eye-popping amount was a major show of Democratic support for Biden at a time of persistently low poll numbers.,"right"

WASHINGTON  - Democrat Joe Biden stood on the cusp of winning the presidency Friday night, three days after Election Day, as the long, exacting work of counting votes widened his lead over President Donald Trump in critical battleground states.,"right"
But Biden held leads in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia, putting him in an ever-stronger position to capture the 270 Electoral College votes needed to take the White House.,"right"
There was intense focus on Pennsylvania, where Biden led Trump by more than 27,000 votes, and Nevada, where the Democrat led by about 22,000.,"right"
Trump stayed in the White House and out of sight, as more results trickled in and expanded Biden's lead in must-win Pennsylvania.,"right"
Biden, for his part, addressed the nation Friday night near his home in Wilmington, Delaware, and acknowledged the sluggish pace of the count "can be numbing." But he added, "Never forget the tallies aren't just numbers: They represent votes and voters.","right"
Kamala Harris, and against a backdrop of flags, Biden wasn't able to give the acceptance speech his aides had hoped.,"right"
In all four states the margins between Trump and Biden were too narrow and the number of ballots left to be counted too great for the AP to declare a victor.,"right"
He took to Twitter late Friday to pledge further legal action, tweeting that "Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President.,"right"
Biden spent Thursday trying to ease tensions and project a more traditional image of presidential leadership.,"right"
The process is working," Biden said.,"right"
The AP has declared Biden the winner in Arizona and said Thursday that it was monitoring the vote count as it proceeded.,"right"
President Biden announced the initiatives as state and federal officials from both political parties grapple with how to curb a drug epidemic that has killed more than 300,000 people during his administration.,"right"
Biden, who dropped out of the presidential race and is endorsing Vice President Harris against former President Donald Trump, urged Congress to greenlight a border security bill.,"right"
“These are the key investments needed to stop fentanyl from reaching our communities,” Biden said in a statement.,"right"
Biden also issued a national security memo calling on federal agencies “to do even more” to stop fentanyl trafficking.,"right"
“The Biden administration is more committed to maintaining the appearance of vigorous punishment for drug trafficking than learning the lessons of the drug war,” Liz Komar, an attorney for the Sentencing Project, a D.C. nonprofit organization that advocates for more humane sentences, said Tuesday.,"right"
A senior Biden administration official said the proposals also include making xylazine, the animal tranquilizer that is increasingly added to fentanyl and causes skin infections, a Schedule III substance, mirroring bills with bipartisan support.,"right"
Biden also proposed creating a national registry that would allow law enforcement to track presses used to make fentanyl pills disguised as legal prescription drugs.,"right"

LOS ANGELES - In President Joe Biden's estimation, the U.S. is in a strong position to overcome the worst inflation in more than 40 years.,"right"
But so far, inflation just keeps getting the better of the U.S. economy and of the Biden administration.,"right"
Biden on Friday pledged to keep fighting against inflation while touring the Port of Los Angeles, America's busiest port and a place that the White House said last October would be key for reducing price pressures.,"right"
Rising prices are imperiling the U.S. economy as well as Democratic control of the House and Senate, putting Biden on the defensive.,"right"
The pain at the pump is hurting Biden's public approval ahead of the midterm elections.,"right"
Biden specifically targeted ExxonMobil for not doing more to increase oil production.,"right"
ExxonMobil responded to Biden's comment by saying that it is producing more oil.,"right"
But he specifically credited the "convening powers of the federal government to bring people to the table" and the Biden administration's focus on the supply chain.,"right"
The Biden administration is seeking to further reduce shipping prices with a bipartisan bill that the House could pass as soon as next week.,"right"
Strong consumer demand has been a mixed blessing for Biden.,"right"
Biden is also trying to frame inflation as a global challenge, having been triggered first by the pandemic and then by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.,"right"
Biden has attempted to slow inflation by improving port operations and twice releasing oil from the U.S. strategic reserve, in addition to other regulatory initiatives and a domestic agenda that includes budget deficit reduction and would need congressional approval.,"right"
The visit to the port occurs as Biden has been hosting the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles.,"right"
It left Texas as the only state where the Biden administration is unable to enforce its interpretation of a federal law in an effort to ensure women still have access to emergency abortions when their health or life is at risk.,"right"
Texas had asked the justices to leave the order in place while the Biden administration had asked the justices to throw it out.,"right"

The Biden administration issued guidance saying hospitals still needed to provide abortions in emergency situations under a health care law that requires most hospitals to treat any patients in medical distress.,"right"
ANNAPOLIS, Maryland (AP) - President Joe Biden told Naval Academy graduates Friday that they will be 'œrepresentatives and defenders of our democracy,'ť as free societies are under threat from Russia's invasion of Ukraine to China's maritime expansion.,"right"
Delivering a commencement address to more than 1,000 newly commissioned ensigns and second lieutenants at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium, Biden said the Western response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's 'œbrutal'ť war in Ukraine shows the world is aligning not on geography, 'œbut in terms of values.'ť,"right"
'œThe actions taken by Putin were an attempt, to use my phrase, to Finland-ize all of Europe, to make it all neutral,'ť Biden said.,"right"
Biden told graduates that while they will learn to fly the most advanced planes, staff cutting-edge ships and utilize novel technologies, 'œThe most powerful tool that you'll wield is our unmatched network of global alliances and the strength of our partnerships.'ť,"right"
Biden did not address two mass shootings in as many weeks in his remarks.,"right"
He, along with first lady Jill Biden, will visit Uvalde, Texas on Sunday to console grieving families after Tuesday's shooting at an elementary school that killed 19 children and two teachers, the White House said.,"right"
Biden's remarks to the Naval Academy marked his first commencement address of the year.,"right"
WASHINGTON — Former President Barack Obama has privately expressed concerns to Democrats about President Joe Biden’s candidacy, and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi privately warned Biden that Democrats could lose the ability to seize control in the House if he didn’t step away from the race.,"right"
Pelosi also showed Biden polling that he likely can’t defeat Republican Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss it.,"right"
Time racing, Democrats at the highest levels are making a critical push for Biden to reconsider his reelection bid, as unease grows at the White House and within the campaign at a fraught moment for the president and his party.,"right"
Biden has insisted he is not backing down, adamant that he is the candidate who beat Republican Donald Trump before and will do it again this year.,"right"
Pressed about reports that Biden might be softening to the idea of leaving the race, his deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said Thursday: “He is not wavering on anything.”,"right"
Some Democrats hope Biden will assess the trajectory of the race and his legacy during this few days’ pause.,"right"
Using mountains of data showing Biden’s standing could wipe out the ranks of Democrats in Congress, frank conversations in public and private, and now, the president’s own time off the campaign trail after testing positive for COVID-19, many Democrats see an opportunity to encourage a reassessment.,"right"
If Democrats are seriously preparing the extraordinary step of replacing Biden and shifting Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, this weekend will be critical to changing the president's mind, other people familiar with the private conversations said.,"right"
Adam Schiff, a close ally of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, became the highest-profile House Democrat to call for Biden to drop his reelection bid, saying that while the decision is Biden's alone to make, he believes it's time to “pass the torch.”,"right"
Biden, in a radio interview taped just before he tested positive for COVID-19, dismissed the idea it was too late for him to recover politically, telling Univision's Luis Sandoval that it's still early and that many people don't focus on the election until September.,"right"
While the tensions over Biden's ability to carry on a winning campaign subsided some, particularly after the Trump assassination attempt and as the Republican National Convention was underway in Milwaukee, Democrats know they have limited time to resolve the party turmoil after the president's faltering debate performance last month.,"right"
To be sure, many Democrats want Biden to stay in the race.,"right"
And the Democratic National Committee is pushing ahead with plans for a virtual vote to formally make Biden its nominee in the first week of August, ahead of the Democratic National Convention that begins Aug.,"right"
Late Wednesday, ABC News reported new details about Biden's private meeting over the weekend with Schumer at the president's beach home in Delaware.,"right"
Leader Schumer conveyed the views of his caucus directly to President Biden on Saturday.”,"right"
White House spokesman Andrew Bates said Biden told Schumer, as well as Jeffries, that “he is the nominee of the party, he plans to win, and looks forward to working with both of them to pass his 100 days agenda to help working families.”,"right"
But among Democrats nationwide, nearly two-thirds say Biden should step aside and let his party nominate a different candidate, according to a new AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.,"right"
That sharply undercuts Biden's post-debate claim that “average Democrats” are still with him even if some “big names” are turning on him.,"right"
Biden tested positive for COVID-19 while traveling Wednesday in Las Vegas and is experiencing “mild symptoms” including “general malaise” from the infection, the White House said.,"right"
Schiff's announcement brings to nearly 20 the number of Democratic members of Congress calling on Biden to withdraw from the presidential race in the wake of his dismal debate performance against Trump last month.,"right"
Schiff said that by bowing out, Biden would “secure his legacy of leadership by allowing us to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election.”,"right"
It was Pelosi who revived questions about Biden post-debate, when she said recently that “it’s up to the president” to decide what to do — even though Biden had already fully stated he had no intention of stepping aside.,"right"
In response to Schiff's comments, the Biden campaign pointed to what it called “extensive support” for him and his reelection bid from members of Congress in key swing states, as well as from the Congressional Black and Hispanic caucuses.,"right"
The campaign noted that Biden had been joined on his trip to Nevada this week by nearly a dozen Congressional Black Caucus members.,"right"
Still, Schiff's announcement came after Schumer and Jeffries encouraged the party to delay for a week plans to hold the virtual vote to renominate Biden, which could have taken place as soon as Sunday, according to two people familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.,"right"
Dozens of demonstrators lined Higgins Road near the entrance to the Elk Grove Technology Park on Thursday to voice their displeasure with President Joe Biden's stance on vaccine mandates during his visit.,"right"
John Zinkis, 21, of Wheaton stood on a street corner with a small sign saying, “Tax the rich.” At one point, he was confronted by two anti-Biden demonstrators, one running from across Higgins Road to yell at Zinkis.,"right"
But shortly before Biden's arrival, bicycle-riding police officers moved all the protesters to the north side of Higgins.,"right"
Sycamore resident Phil Cuthbert joined the protest before Biden's arrival.,"right"
And for president, Democrat Joe Biden.,"right"
"Biden wouldn't have been my first choice in the Democratic primary to run against Trump, but I believe that of the two candidates, he's the best choice for the country," he said.,"right"
I 100% agree with the pardon of Hunter Biden and here’s why.,"right"
If I were President Biden, I would issue a pardon to every Cabinet member and their top assistants across the board.,"right"
Biden Jr. as President of the United States and Kamala D.,"right"
Ever since Thursday's debate, it has been clear to the American public that a mentally compromised President Joe Biden has put his own ego ahead of the country — a charge the left has hurled at Donald Trump from his first day in office.,"right"
Now the big-media mantra is that it is such a shame that Biden isn't up to the job because, while he shouldn't be in the Oval Office, he really is such an incredibly good guy.,"right"
A New York Times headline for a Thomas Friedman column captured big media's lamentations: “Joe Biden is a Good Man and a Good President.,"right"
I don't think Biden is as good as he likes to portray himself.,"right"
To start, Biden has stayed in office past his due date, with little regard for what's best for the country or the American people.,"right"
Biden likes to say that he devoted his life to public service, but he wasn't putting the public first.,"right"
What's more, Biden's inner circle was limited to people who played along with the charade — yes, people who wouldn't challenge him.,"right"
Biden has failed to live up to his promise to voters who were led to believe that if elected, the former vice president would govern as a steady hand and a moderate.,"right"
In office, Biden has governed further to the left of the man who picked him to be his running mate.,"right"
Biden did.,"right"
In 1991, when then-President George H.W. Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court, Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.,"right"
Biden had no problem raking Thomas over the coals for the essentially uncorroborated charge that Thomas had sexually harassed attorney Anita Hill when she was a subordinate in the Department of Education and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.,"right"
Biden was one of 48 senators to vote against the justice's confirmation.,"right"
Yet Biden had no problem palling around with the late Sen.,"right"
Later according to Politico, Biden offered that the Thomas hearings brought up the issue of “sexual harassment,” an issue “no one wanted to touch.” Like he was so good.,"right"
In 2012, then Vice President Biden warned a racially mixed audience that, if elected, GOP nominee Mitt Romney would “put y'all back in chains.” A cheap shot against a good man.,"right"
But really, that never stopped Joe Biden.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will address the nation from the Oval Office on Wednesday evening on his decision to drop his 2024 Democratic reelection bid.,"right"
Biden posted on X that he would speak “on what lies ahead” and how he will “finish the job for the American people.” He will speak at 8 p.m. ET.,"right"
Biden is now testing negative for the virus and his symptoms have resolved, according to a letter from his doctor, Kevin O’Connor, released Tuesday.,"right"
Biden has not been seen publicly since July 17, but he called into a campaign meeting on Monday to address staff and express his support for Harris’ bid to replace him a day after announcing he would leave the race.,"right"
BELLEAU, France (AP) — President Joe Biden closed out his trip to France by paying his respects at an American military cemetery that Donald Trump notably skipped when he was president, hoping his final stop Sunday helped draw the stakes of the November election in stark relief.,"right"
Before returning to the United States, Biden honored America’s war dead at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery about an hour outside Paris.,"right"
But during an election year when Trump has called into question fundamental understandings about America's global role, Biden has embraced his Republican predecessor — and would-be successor — as a latent foil.,"right"
Biden's paeans to the struggle between democracy and autocracy drew plaudits in Europe, where the prospect of a return to Trump's turbulent reign has sparked no shortage of anxiety.,"right"
But it remains to be seen how the message will resonate with American voters, as Biden's campaign struggles to connect the dire warnings the Democratic president so often delivers about his rival with people's daily concerns.,"right"
“It’s the same story," Biden said.,"right"
Trump’s purported insults have become a regular feature of Biden’s campaign speeches, including during an April rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania.,"right"
“These soldiers were heroes, just as every American who has served this nation,” Biden said.,"right"
Biden ignored a direct question about Trump at the cemetery but said it was important to visit the hallowed ground.,"right"
Trump, at a campaign rally in Las Vegas, said Sunday after Biden had left France that the president's performance overseas was “terrible" and embarrassing, though Trump did not cite anything in particular.,"right"
“This is not a representative for what used to be the greatest country,” he told his supporters, adding that under Biden "we are a nation in major decline and we’re going to stop it immediately.”,"right"
Maura Sullivan, a former Marine officer who served on the American Battle Monuments Commission under President Barack Obama, said Biden's visit would “set the example, and do what a president should do.” Now an official with the New Hampshire Democratic Party, Sullivan said that “voters can draw their own conclusions” from that.,"right"
Biden’s trip was full of emotional moments, and the president grew heavy-eyed after meeting with World War II veterans.,"right"
“This has been the most remarkable trip that I’ve ever made,” Biden said on Saturday night, his last in Paris before returning to the U.S.,"right"
At Aisne-Marne, Biden said the trip “surprised me how much it awakened my sense of why it’s so valuable to have these alliances.,"right"
On Thursday at Normandy anniversary ceremonies, Biden said D-Day served a reminder that alliances make the United States stronger, calling it “a lesson that I pray we Americans never forget.” He also highlighted how the war effort drew on immigrants, women and people of color who were too often overlooked by history.,"right"
By following in an iconic Republican’s footsteps, Biden honed his appeal to traditional conservatives who are often frustrated by Trump's isolationist vision.,"right"
Biden issued a call for Americans to protect democracy like the Rangers who scaled the cliffs, a message that synced with campaign rhetoric that paints his election opponent as an existential threat to U.S. values.,"right"
While Biden was in France, his campaign announced that it had hired the onetime chief of staff to former Republican Rep.,"right"
At Pointe du Hoc, Biden said the Army Rangers “fought to vanquish a hateful ideology in the ’30s and ’40s.,"right"
Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian who wrote a book about Pointe du Hoc and Reagan’s speech, said Biden “had big shoes to step into” by choosing the same location.,"right"
Biden's speech “didn’t equal Reagan’s in grandeur, nor could it,” Brinkley said.,"right"
Still, he said Biden “said the right words about why democracy matters.”,"right"
Paul Begala, a veteran Democratic strategist, said it could help Biden politically “to stand where Reagan stood.","right"
He noted that Biden is struggling with younger voters but appears to be gaining strength among older ones who may be more receptive to reminders of Reagan’s speech four decades ago.,"right"
Biden's trip was also punctuated by the pomp of a state visit in Paris.,"right"
“United we stand, divided we fall,” Macron said in toasting Biden.,"right"
Overall, Biden’s visit had a slower pace than other foreign trips.,"right"
In a Wednesday morning interview, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) repeatedly urged President Biden to make a decision about whether to stay in the presidential race, despite the president’s insistence that he should remain at the top of the Democratic ticket.,"right"
Biden so far has been adamant that he should continue running for reelection, amid increasingly public concerns within the party about his candidacy after his halting performance against Donald Trump in the first debate last month.,"right"
Since the debate, Biden held campaign rallies, sat for an interview with ABC News, sent a lengthy letter to congressional lawmakers, campaigned in Pennsylvania and agreed to hold a news conference Thursday, in the hopes of quelling doubts about his ability to serve a second term.,"right"
Biden and his team also have met with key party leaders — including Rep.,"right"
As of Wednesday morning, only 10 Democratic lawmakers have publicly called on Biden to drop out of the 2024 race.,"right"
But Pelosi’s remarks in her television appearance Wednesday suggested that Biden had yet to make a final decision about whether to continue running.,"right"
Pelosi also implied that she had told Democratic lawmakers to refrain from voicing any opinions about Biden’s candidacy until after the NATO conference, which Biden is hosting in Washington this week.,"right"
“Over 30 heads of state are here … it means [Biden is] orchestrating the discussion and setting the agenda, and he’s doing so magnificently,” Pelosi said.,"right"
Democratic lawmakers remain divided on Biden — and have certainly not remained quiet about their opinions on the president.,"right"
Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) told CNN that Trump was on track to win the election “by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House” if Biden remained in the race.,"right"
Asked to respond to Bennet’s comments, Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said: “No one is more committed to defeating Donald Trump and defending our democracy than Joe Biden, and few know better than Joe Biden the importance of showing up and campaigning to earn the support of voters.,"right"
Blinken, speaking at a news conference in Jordan, was the first U.S. official to publicly confirm contacts between the Biden administration and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which led a coalition of armed opposition groups that drove Assad from power and into asylum in Russia last weekend.,"right"
Joe Biden has called this election "a battle for the soul of the nation.","right"
Donald Trump or Joe Biden?,"right"
Too much division," former Vice President Biden said when accepting the Democratic nomination in August, "Here and now, I give you my word: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst.","right"
We endorse Joe Biden.,"right"
Joe Biden is not a perfect man, nor would he be a perfect president.,"right"
In Senator Kamala Harris, he chose an able running mate ready to work on behalf of the Biden agenda and with the credentials worthy of her proximity, if elected, a heart beat away.,"right"
Biden's empathy is real and he understands that part of leadership is listening to muted voices.,"right"
Amid the nervous doubts about whether disputes over election results might lead to a constitutional crisis, Biden looked into the camera and in the reassuring tone of a parent, said in effect: Don't worry, just vote.,"right"
As vice president and an active teammate with President Obama, Biden played a key role in saving the country from a depression by helping to engineer a remarkable economic recovery from the financial crisis that greeted the administration as it took office.,"right"
This does not get enough attention: The country's economy was near collapse, and Biden helped save it.,"right"
To those who admire President Trump's economic chops, it's good to remember that Biden has shown some economic chops too.,"right"
And Biden would create a coherent national policy we should have had nine months ago to address the pandemic, relying on scientific guidance and data.,"right"
Biden is a unifying figure at a critical moment for this country as we navigate a deadly pandemic, a teetering economy and a burst of racial tensions and civil unrest we haven't seen in a generation.,"right"
We are weary, but Biden gives us hope.,"right"
Joe Biden for president.,"right"
The choice for Democrats: Biden Of two presidential contenders, the former vice president offers best hope to heal nation,"right"
In an interview with the Financial Times, the longtime Washington political analyst Charlie Cook noted that President Joe Biden's job approval rating has been stuck below 50% for a long time - two and a half years - and shows no signs of rising above 50% anytime soon.,"right"
Biden started his presidency, in January 2021, with a 57% approval rating.,"right"
By July 2021, Biden fell below 50% for the first time and has never returned.,"right"
For 2 1/2 years, Biden's job approval has bounced around in a roughly 8-point range between highs in the mid 40s and lows in the high 30s.,"right"
That's what Cook meant about lack of elasticity - Biden doesn't seem to go up and down in relation to his accomplishments or lack of accomplishments.,"right"
Some Biden supporters like to point out that President Barack Obama had some tough times in the polls before he won reelection in 2012.,"right"
The difference between Obama and Biden is 1) Obama occasionally rose back to 50% or higher, as he did in February and April of 2010, and January and May of 2011; and 2) although Obama fell to 40% a few times, he never sank below that.,"right"
The great hope of Biden partisans is that he will rise in the polls as November's election approaches, as Obama did in 2012.,"right"
So can Biden replicate that feat?,"right"
But where will Biden start from?,"right"
Trump's trajectory in the Gallup Poll was different from Biden's and Obama's.,"right"
Today, Biden is closer to Trump territory - actually, in December, he was six points below where Trump was at the same time in his presidency - than to Obama.,"right"
To win in November, Biden will have to stage an energetic recovery.,"right"
Everybody knows the reasons for Biden's unpopularity.,"right"
Biden-era inflation has made going to the grocery store an ordeal for millions of Americans.,"right"
The world seems to be blowing up - Ukraine, the Middle East - which has many Americans worried that more might be on the way if Biden remains in the Oval Office.,"right"
Biden can only do so much to recover.,"right"
(One recent Washington Post column began: "There's only one appropriate word to describe the U.S. economy in 2023: 'miracle.'") As far as the world situation is concerned, certainly it cannot all be laid at Biden's feet, but it does bring to mind the words of former Defense Secretary and CIA Director Robert Gates, who in 2014 wrote that Biden "has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades." Biden hasn't gotten any better.,"right"
Finally, the one thing that Biden absolutely, positively, unquestionably cannot do is get any younger.,"right"
The White House, the Biden campaign and the Democratic Party know they are just one serious health episode away from a crisis in which they have to find a new presidential candidate in an election year.,"right"
Biden's handlers are working to make sure he gets his rest, but there is only so much they can do.,"right"
That doesn't mean Biden can't make it to November and win reelection.,"right"
But Biden's current situation - polls, age, job performance - just doesn't look good.,"right"
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden has ordered retaliatory strikes against Iranian-backed militia groups after three U.S. servicemembers injured in a drone attack in Northern Iraq.,"right"
Biden, who is spending Christmas at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland, was briefed on the attack on Monday and ordered the Pentagon to prepare response options.,"right"
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and national security team quickly drew up plans and presented him with options in a call and Biden directed strikes against three locations utilized by Kataib Hezbollah and affiliated groups.,"right"
President Joe Biden touted his record during the recent State of the Union address.,"right"
Now our economy is literally the envy of the world!” Biden said during the March 7 address.,"right"
But there is an issue with Biden’s comparison to other administrations, according to the Washington Post.,"right"
The final year of Biden’s first term could change the numbers.,"right"
The rise in population has also helped Biden’s statistics, which makes the record misleading, the Post said.,"right"
During the SOTU address, Biden also claimed, “Inflation has dropped from 9% to 3% – the lowest in the world.”,"right"
During a news conference earlier this month at the White House, President Joe Biden touted a consumer protection law that guards against patients being hit with unexpected medical charges.,"right"
"We just made surprise medical bills illegal in this country," Biden said.,"right"
1, 2022, deadline, but Biden can't take credit for creating it, according to The Associated Press.,"right"
The act was signed by former President Donald Trump in December 2020, after the election but before Biden took office.,"right"
WASHINGTON — Nearly two-thirds of Democrats say President Joe Biden should withdraw from the presidential race and let his party nominate a different candidate, according to a new poll, sharply undercutting his post-debate claim that “average Democrats” are still with him even if some “big names” are turning on him.,"right"
The new survey by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, conducted as Biden works to salvage his candidacy two weeks after his debate flop, also found that only about 3 in 10 Democrats are extremely or very confident that he has the mental capability to serve effectively as president, down slightly from 40% in an AP-NORC poll in February.,"right"
It’s unclear whether the shooting influenced people’s views of Biden, but the small number of poll interviews completed after the shooting provided no early indication that his prospects improved.,"right"
Meanwhile, as Vice President Kamala Harris receives additional scrutiny amid the talk about whether Biden should bow out, the poll found that her favorability rating is similar to his — but the share of Americans who have an unfavorable opinion of her is slightly lower.,"right"
The poll provides some evidence that Black Democrats are among Biden’s strongest supporters, with roughly half in the survey saying he should continue running, compared to about 3 in 10 white and Hispanic Democrats.,"right"
Overall, seven in 10 Americans think Biden should drop out, with Democrats only slightly less likely than Republicans and independents to say that he should make way for a new nominee.,"right"
Janie Stapleton, a 50-year-old lifelong Democrat from Walls, Mississippi, held the opposite view, saying Biden is the “best candidate” for president.,"right"
People aren't just sour on Biden on as they size up their choices this election season.,"right"
As for Biden, younger Democrats are especially likely to want to see him bow out — and to say they’re dissatisfied with him.,"right"
Three-quarters of Democrats under the age of 45 want Biden to drop out, compared to about 6 in 10 of those who are older.,"right"
She identifies as a Democratic-leaning independent, and while she thinks Biden is probably still mentally up to the job, she worries that the past few weeks' unraveling of support makes him a weak candidate, no matter what happens next.,"right"
Despite bullish talk from the Biden campaign heading into the debate, the faceoff only left the president in a deeper hole.,"right"
Democrats are slightly more likely to say they’re dissatisfied with Biden as their nominee now than they were before his halting performance.,"right"
David Parrott, a Democrat from Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee, was willing to give Biden the benefit of the doubt given the president’s age, but he still voiced concerns about a potential second term.,"right"
All of the recent churn has left Americans much more likely to think Trump is capable of winning the 2024 election than is Biden — 42% to 18%.,"right"
Only about a third of Democrats believe Biden is more capable of winning than is Trump.,"right"
Trump also has the edge on Biden when Americans consider who is most capable of handling a crisis, 38% to 28%.,"right"
And people are about equally divided on which candidate has the better vision for the country, with 35% saying Biden and 34% Trump.,"right"
For all of the disenchantment Biden is up against, the president insists it's not too late to turn things around, saying past presidents have come back from a deficit at this stage in the campaign.,"right"
The poll did also offer a bright spot for Biden: 40% of adults say he’s more honest than Trump, while about 2 in 10 think the opposite.,"right"
Somewhat more have a negative view of Biden: approximately 6 in 10 Americans.,"right"
Unions are once again testing whether President Joe Biden can deliver on his promise of a manufacturing boom that boosts organized labor.,"right"
That’s just the latest example of how labor unions are pushing to organize a wave of new factories spurred by Biden’s economic policies, which offer hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for technologies from semiconductors to clean energy and electric vehicles.,"right"
The CWA, like the UAW, has endorsed Biden in the 2024 presidential race.,"right"
Cummings pointed to one key lever the Biden administration can pull: Funding from the Chips Act will be distributed over time, contingent on companies meeting certain construction, production and other benchmarks — and it can be clawed back if firms don’t hold up their end of the deal.,"right"
That staggered payment schedule, he said, gives the Biden administration negotiating power.,"right"
The pressure and chaos swirling since Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance is causing cracks in a White House that until now had been marked by discipline and loyalty.,"right"
For three-plus years, the Biden administration has been mostly a restrained and staid operation, defined more by an insistence on showcasing policy and an avoidance of palace intrigue.,"right"
Biden's shaky June 27 debate performance has led to an unusually public blame game, leaks of private phone calls between the president and Democrats and questions about his son Hunter Biden's presence at the White House.,"right"
It has prompted current White House officials to anonymously vent their concerns about Biden's ability to do the job and even led to the departure of a radio journalist after details emerged that the Biden campaign had fed her and another reporter interview questions.,"right"
Not to mention all the drama playing out on Capitol Hill, where a handful of House Democrats have publicly called for Biden to step aside and there is closed-door hand-wringing by others over whether to publicly come out against the president as party leaders try to bring members to heel.,"right"
Biden has been adamant that he is not leaving the race, and the chorus of criticism may be dying down, but it’s not clear yet whether the White House drama has been a momentary lapse or will continue as the nation barrels toward the 2024 election.,"right"
Andrew Bates, a senior deputy press secretary, said Biden had “restored compassion, honesty, and competence to the Oval Office” and built the most diverse administration in history.,"right"
“As President Biden has fought for and delivered the strongest record of any modern administration, there wasn’t a single week that Washington didn’t doubt him and his team," Bates said.,"right"
The buttoned-up vibe at the White House under Biden has been intentional — he wanted his administration to be viewed as a return to normal governing operations after the leaky Trump White House, when half-baked policies ended up on the front pages and details of private meetings appeared in public sometimes while they were still underway.,"right"
It was also reflective of the deep loyalty of Biden's inner circle, where many top advisers have worked with the president for decades.,"right"
Biden's debate performance prompted a surprising amount of public criticism from some of his biggest fans, including former White House communications director Kate Bedingfield, who was on a cable TV panel immediately after the faceoff.,"right"
“It was a really disappointing debate performance from Joe Biden.,"right"
In private, aides and allies were quietly shaken over how Biden performed in the debate, and wondered whether the campaign was salvageable, particularly as the negative reviews kept pouring in.,"right"
At Camp David the weekend after the debate, Biden's family — in particular Hunter Biden and first lady Jill Biden — encouraged the president to stay in the race, and questioned whether his staff had prepared him properly.,"right"
(Biden, for his part, has said firmly the debate disaster was “nobody's fault but mine.”),"right"
Not long after, the presence of Hunter Biden — awaiting sentencing on three felony convictions in a gun case — at the White House was unsettling to some people, who worried about his influence with his father, according to two Democrats close to the White House who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.,"right"
And there's been the second-guessing over the long-term strategy to limit Biden's public interactions, especially with journalists, under a mandate led by senior aides.,"right"
Biden has granted fewer interviews than his modern predecessors, and he's held fewer news conferences than any president since Ronald Reagan.,"right"
Bates said the strategy “is and has been for the American people to hear directly from Joe Biden.” He noted Biden gave an interview Monday to MSNBC's “Morning Joe,” has taken questions from reporters more than 580 times and travels the country speaking to people directly.,"right"
In an effort to boost staff morale, Biden chief of staff Jeff Zients urged White House aides last week during an all-staff meeting to tune out the “noise” and focus on the task of governing.,"right"
Jean-Pierre told reporters Biden had not been seen by his doctor since his physical, but the president later told campaign workers on a private call that he had been seen by his doctor after he felt sick returning from grueling back-to-back foreign trips.,"right"
White House aides declined for days to explain a neurologist’s repeated visits to the White House that had sparked speculation that Biden was getting treatment, and Jean-Pierre misspoke when talking about the issue Tuesday.,"right"
On Sunday, a radio host departed her job after news that she and another interviewer at a different station had asked questions of Biden that had been fed to them by the campaign.,"right"
The interviews were meant to be part of an effort to restore faith in Biden’s ability not just to govern over the next four years but to successfully campaign, but the revelation only added to criticism that he couldn’t handle unscripted questioning.,"right"
HELSINKI (AP) - President Joe Biden said he and other NATO leaders showed the world that the military alliance remains "more united than ever," as he on Thursday capped off a trip in Europe meant to demonstrate the force of the international coalition against Russia's invasion of Ukraine.,"right"
The allies "understand that this fight is not only a fight for the future of Ukraine," Biden said, noting that it's also about sovereignty and security.,"right"
Will we stay committed to our course?" Biden said.,"right"
Earlier Thursday, Biden met with the leaders of other Nordic nations including Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.,"right"
Biden's brief stop in the shoreline Finnish capital is the coda to a tour that was carefully sketched to highlight the growth of a military alliance that the president says has fortified itself since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.,"right"
Biden arrived in Helsinki after what he deemed a successful NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, where allies agreed to language that would further pave the way for Ukraine to also become a futuremember.,"right"
Biden and other administration officials also held what aides said were pivotal conversations with Turkey before that country dropped its objections to Sweden joining NATO.,"right"
Biden said he felt good about the trip.,"right"
And despite Zelenskyy's expressed frustrations, Biden - who met with the Ukrainian leader Wednesday in Vilnius - said Thursday that Zelenskyy "ended up being very happy.","right"
In contrast, Biden has heartily embraced the tenets of multilateralism that Trump shunned, speaking repeatedly of having to rebuild international coalitions after four tumultuous years led by his predecessor.,"right"
Opening the broader meeting, Niinistö said his Nordic counterparts had one overriding objective: "guarantee the future - security-wise, environmental-wise and technology-wise." Biden added that the "nations around the table not only share common history, but we share common challenges, and I would add presumptuously, common values.","right"
Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, who saw Biden in the Oval Office last week, lightheartedly remarked to Biden that "I have met you more than I've met my own family.","right"
Biden also scheduled a news conference with Niinistö before departing for Washington.,"right"
Biden is the sixth U.S president to visit Finland, a country of 5.5 million that has hosted several U.S.-Soviet and U.S.-Russia summits.,"right"
But Charly Salonius-Pasternak, senior researcher at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, noted that Biden's visit marked the first time a sitting U.S. president came to Finland to honor the country itself, rather than as a neutral location for meeting Russian leaders or other similar reasons.,"right"
"The fact that Biden has chosen to go specifically to Finland for Finland is symbolic and, in some ways, very concrete," he said.,"right"
WASHINGTON - The Justice Department is reviewing a batch of potentially classified documents found in the Washington office space of President Joe Biden's former institute, the White House said Monday.,"right"
Special counsel to the president Richard Sauber said "a small number of documents with classified markings" were discovered as Biden's personal attorneys were clearing out the offices of the Penn Biden Center, where the president kept an office after he left the vice presidency in 2017 until shortly before he launched his 2020 presidential campaign in 2019.,"right"
"Since that discovery, the President's personal attorneys have cooperated with the Archives and the Department of Justice in a process to ensure that any Obama-Biden Administration records are appropriately in the possession of the Archives," Sauber said.,"right"
Irrespective of the Justice Department review, the revelation that Biden potentially mishandled classified or presidential records could prove to be a political headache for the president, who called Trump's decision to keep hundreds of such records at his private club in Florida "irresponsible.","right"
Trump weighed in Monday on his social media site, asking, "When is the FBI going to raid the many homes of Joe Biden, perhaps even the White House?","right"
The revelation comes as Republicans have taken control of the House of Representatives and are promising to launch widespread investigations of Biden's administration.,"right"
Are they going to raid the Bidens?" he asked reporters.,"right"
Jamie Raskin, said Biden's attorneys "appear to have taken immediate and proper action.","right"
"They certainly knew about the raid on Mar-a-Lago 91 days before this election, but nice if on November 2, the country would have known that there were classified documents at the Biden Center.","right"
The think tank, formally known as the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, is affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania and continues to operate independently of the Biden administration.,"right"
It claims President Joe Biden has "never set foot in the real White House" while ignoring the fact he also served two terms as vice president.,"right"
It says the military took control of the White House following the November election and would not let Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris inside.,"right"
It asserts that Harris (not Biden) ordered the Secret Service to storm the building and a resulting firefight killed two Secret Service agents and a Marine.,"right"
It further asserts the Biden administration conducts business at an 80%-scale replica White House on an Atlanta property owned by actor Tyler Perry.,"right"
It's supposedly from that location that Biden has hosted foreign dignitaries and press secretary Jen Psaki holds her daily briefings.,"right"
Biden didn't plan pandemic,"right"
During a CNN town hall last month, President Joe Biden was promoting the COVID-19 vaccine and touting the years of medical research that went into the development of vaccines to combat viruses.,"right"
Internet users misconstrued that statement to claim Biden said the pandemic was planned, <URL destination="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/08/05/fact-check-biden-decades-research-went-into-covid-19-vaccines/5486534001/">according to USA Today.,"right"
Biden was referencing more than 20 years of research scientists have been doing on other coronaviruses such as SARS.,"right"
WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden predicted Tuesday that the U.S.-Mexico border would be "chaotic for a while" when pandemic-related restrictions end, as 550 active-duty troops began arriving and migrants weighed whether or when to cross.,"right"
Biden said his administration was working to make the change orderly.,"right"
Biden and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador spoke for roughly an hour Tuesday to discuss the border.,"right"
The Biden administration's plan is meant to crack down on those who cross illegally and by creating new pathways meant to offer alternatives to a dangerous and often deadly journey.,"right"
The Biden administration has said it is ready to deal with whatever happens after Title 42's use ends, although it has also repeatedly criticized Congress for not making changes to the country's immigration system.,"right"
WASHINGTON (AP) - Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch is taking on a new role as the honorary chairman of a nonpartisan group devoted to education about the Constitution, replacing former Vice President Joe Biden.,"right"
Biden stepped down when he launched his campaign for the presidency in April.,"right"
WASHINGTON  — President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday reached a required agreement with President Joe Biden's White House to allow his transition staff to coordinate with the existing federal workforce before taking office on Jan.,"right"
1, according to the Presidential Transition Act, and the Biden White House had issued both public and private appeals for Trump's team to sign on.,"right"
Biden himself raised the agreement with Trump when they met in the Oval Office on Nov.,"right"
Trump chief of staff-designate Susie Wiles met with Biden's chief of staff Jeff Zients at the White House on Nov.,"right"
"Like President Biden said to the American people from the Rose Garden and directly to President-elect Trump, he is committed to an orderly transition," said White House spokesperson Saloni Sharma.,"right"
Without the signed agreement, Biden administration officials were restricted in what they could share with the incoming team.,"right"
Mike Waltz met recently with Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan, but the outgoing team was limited in what it could discuss.,"right"
President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign is spending $50 million through the end of June, a blitz that includes its first television ad trumpeting Donald Trump’s felony conviction and signals that the Democratic incumbent is seeking to make his Republican opponent’s legal woes a bigger issue heading into November.,"right"
But Biden's campaign says it wants to more clearly define the choice between the candidates ahead of the first debate between them in Atlanta on June 27.,"right"
It adds over images of a Trump mug shot and Biden high-fiving supporters, “This election is between a convicted criminal who's only out for himself and a president who's fighting for your family.”,"right"
Biden also has frequently talked about Trump’s 34 felony convictions while decrying the former president for claiming that the case against him was politically motivated.,"right"
Biden argues that “it’s reckless, it’s dangerous, it’s irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don’t like the verdict.”,"right"
Biden's son Hunter last week was convicted in Delaware of three felony charges related to the purchase of a revolver in 2018, when, prosecutors argued, he lied on a mandatory gun purchase form by saying he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs.,"right"
A central part of Biden’s reelection strategy is also highlighting Trump’s policy proposals for a second term and firing up disaffected Democrats and independent voters.,"right"
Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has speculated that Biden or Justice Department officials orchestrated the New York case against him for political reasons.,"right"
Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that the Biden administration had “weaponized the justice system against President Trump” and that the contrast between her candidate and Biden “will be very clear on the debate stage.”,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden, who belatedly opted against seeking reelection, will pay a visit on Monday to the library of the last president to make the same difficult choice, more than a half-century ago.,"right"
Biden's speech Monday at the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin, Texas, is designed to mark the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, enacted under President Lyndon Johnson.,"right"
But the visit has taken on very different symbolism in the two weeks it took to reschedule it after Biden had to cancel because he got COVID-19.,"right"
The speech, originally set for July 15, was once seen by the White House as an opportunity for Biden to try to make a case for salvaging his sinking presidential campaign — delivered in the home district of Rep.,"right"
Lloyd Doggett, the 15-term congressman who was the first Democratic lawmaker to publicly call for Biden to step aside.,"right"
Biden is out of the race.,"right"
No American incumbent president has dropped out of the race as late in the process as did Biden.,"right"
Biden has drawn a lot of comparisons to Johnson of late.,"right"
Biden, 81, had every intention of running for reelection until his shaky June 27 debate performance ignited fears within his own party about his age and mental acuity, and whether he could beat Republican Donald Trump.,"right"
Biden has called Trump a serious threat to democracy, particularly after the ex-president's efforts in 2020 to overturn the results of the election he lost and his continued lies about that loss.,"right"
That’s the best way to unite our nation,” Biden said in his Oval Office address.,"right"
Biden decided to seek the presidency in 2020 after witnessing the violence at a 2017 “Unite The Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where torch-wielding white supremacists marched to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen.,"right"
Biden said he was horrified by Trump’s response, particularly when the Republican told reporters that “you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.”,"right"
During his presidency, Biden has often put equity and civil rights at the forefront, including with his choice for vice president.,"right"
Biden's administration has worked to combat racial discrimination in the real estate market, he pardoned thousands of people convicted on federal marijuana charges that have disproportionately affected people of color and provided federal funding to reconnect city neighborhoods that were racially segregated or divided by road projects, and also invested billions in historically Black colleges and universities.,"right"
Biden has said he is “determined to get as much done” as he can in his final six months in office, including signing major legislation expanding voting rights and a federal police bill named for George Floyd.,"right"
“I’ll keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose,” Biden said from the Oval Office.,"right"
Later Monday, Biden will also travel to Houston to pay his respects to the late Rep.,"right"
Classified documents were found in a damaged cardboard box in President Joe Biden's cluttered Delaware garage, near where golf clubs hung on the wall.,"right"
In Biden's case, special counsel Robert Hur, a former U.S. attorney for Maryland nominated by Trump, concluded in a report released Thursday that the president should not face criminal charges, despite finding evidence that Biden willfully retained classified information.,"right"
Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing in the case brought by special counsel Jack Smith, slammed the decision not to charge Biden, saying: “THIS IS A TWO-TIERED SYSTEM OF JUSTICE!” Biden, late Thursday, angrily lashed out at Hur for unflattering characterizations of his memory in the report and said he never shared classified information.,"right"
At look at the similarities and differences between the Biden and Trump investigations:,"right"
BIDEN: FBI agents found classified documents about Afghanistan in Biden's Delaware garage in 2022, along with drafts of a handwritten memo Biden sent to President Barack Obama to persuade Obama not to send more troops into the country, Hur's report said.,"right"
In an office and basement den in the Delaware home, agents also found notebooks with classified information that Biden wrote on during briefings with Obama and in White House Situation Room meetings, the report said.,"right"
Investigators said the notebooks included national security and foreign policy information that touched on “sensitive intelligence sources and methods.” Hur found that on at least three occasions during interviews with his ghostwriter, Biden read aloud from classified parts from his notebooks “nearly verbatim.”,"right"
Hur concluded there is not enough evidence to convict Biden of “willfully” retaining the Afghanistan documents or the notebooks.,"right"
When the Afghanistan documents were found in the garage in 2022, Biden was allowed to have them because he was president at the time, the report said.,"right"
To bring charges, Hur said prosecutors would have to rely on a comment that Biden had made to his ghostwriter in 2017 — when Biden was a private citizen and living in Virginia — that he had “just found” classified documents downstairs.,"right"
But Hur said Biden could convince some jurors his actions weren't willful by arguing, for example, that he forgot about the documents shortly after finding them in 2017.,"right"
It's also possible the Afghanistan documents were never in the Virginia home at all, but were accidentally kept without Biden's knowledge in Delaware since he was vice president, Hur concluded.,"right"
Hur also cited limitations with Biden’s memory and the president's cooperation with investigators that “could convince some jurors that he made an innocent mistake.,"right"
“We have also considered that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,” the report said.,"right"
Regarding the notebooks containing classified information, Hur concluded that Biden could plausibly argue if there were a trial that he believed that the notebooks were his personal property and he was allowed to take them home.,"right"
“During our interview of him, Mr. Biden was emphatic, declaring that his notebooks are ‘my property’ and that ‘every president before me has done the exact same thing,’ that is, kept handwritten classified materials after leaving office,” the report said.,"right"
Other classified documents found at the Penn Biden Center, Biden's Delaware home, and among Senate papers at the University of Delaware “could plausibly have been brought to these locations by mistake,” Hur concluded.,"right"
Hur's report says the differences between the two cases are “clear.” Unlike Biden — who cooperated with investigators, agreed to searches of his homes and sat for a voluntary interview — the allegations in Trump's case present “serious aggravating facts,” Hur wrote.,"right"
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Hunter Biden arrived Thursday at a Los Angeles courthouse for the first day of jury selection in his federal tax trial, just months after the president’s son was convicted of gun charges in a separate case.,"right"
The case accuses Hunter Biden of a four-year scheme to avoid paying at least $1.4 million in taxes while pulling in millions of dollars from foreign business entities.,"right"
Hunter Biden walked into the courtroom holding hands with his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, and flanked by Secret Service agents.,"right"
U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi, who was appointed to the bench by former President Donald Trump, placed some restrictions on what jurors will be allowed to hear about the traumatic events that Hunter Biden's family, friends and attorneys say led to his drug addiction.,"right"
The judge barred attorneys from connecting his substance abuse struggles to the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer or the car accident that killed his mother and sister when he was a toddler.,"right"
The indictment alleges that Hunter Biden lived lavishly while flouting the tax law, spending his cash on things like strippers and luxury hotels — “in short, everything but his taxes.”,"right"
Hunter Biden’s attorneys had asked Scarsi to also limit prosecutors from highlighting details of his expenses that they say amount to a “character assassination,” including payments made to strippers or pornographic websites.,"right"
Meanwhile, prosecutors could present more details of Hunter Biden’s overseas dealings, which have been at the center of Republican investigations into the Biden family often seeking — without evidence— to tie the president to an alleged influence peddling scheme.,"right"
The special counsel’s team has said it wants to tell jurors about Hunter Biden's work for a Romanian businessman, who they say sought to “influence U.S. government policy” while Joe Biden was vice president.,"right"
The defense accused prosecutors of releasing details about Hunter Biden’s work for the Romanian in court papers to drum up media coverage and taint the jury pool.,"right"
And despite President Joe Biden dropping his bid for reelection, they’ll also answer questions about whether they believe criminal charges can be filed for political reasons.,"right"
Special counsel indicted Hunter Biden soon after, splitting the deal into the Delaware gun charges and the California tax case.,"right"
Sentencing in Hunter Biden's Delaware conviction is set for Nov.,"right"
With Syria in the throes of the Assad regime collapse, the Biden administration is working to locate Austin Tice, an American freelance journalist abducted in Syria a dozen years ago.,"right"
Biden, speaking from the White House on Sunday, expressed hope.,"right"
The Tice family on Friday held a news conference in Washington to appeal to the Biden administration to do more to find Austin.,"right"
I read the other day that President Biden's support continues to erode.,"right"
Most of the questions asked by political animals during President Joe Biden's press conference at NATO Thursday night were variations of the same thought: What are you still doing here after you fumbled and stumbled through the June 27 debate?,"right"
The best version of that query came from Marek Walkuski of Polish Public Radio, who told Biden, “Many people in Poland and across Europe are worried that the former president may win the election.,"right"
Given Trump's many disparaging comments about NATO, Biden was delighted with the question — asked at a NATO conference, no less.,"right"
And really, while Biden seemed to take the question as an opportunity to frame himself as the indispensable man, he didn't seem to give much thought to Eastern Europeans who rightly or wrongly fear that Putin would see a Trump victory as a green light for his evil ambitions.,"right"
Earth to Biden: That question wasn't helpful.,"right"
While Biden's remarks showcased his fluency on international hot spots — and showed, yes, the 81-year-old is capable of having a good moment — his bad night on June 27 cannot be unseen.,"right"
Also, Biden didn't help himself leading with a malapropism — he referred to Kamala Harris as “Vice President Trump” after he mis-introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as “President Putin.”,"right"
By the end of the hour, Biden changed few if any minds about whether he should stay in the presidential race.,"right"
Biden's decision to flex his foreign-policy chops at this time, when Americans are concerned about meat and potato issues — especially their inflation-ravaged pocketbooks — shows a willful blindness to public discontent.,"right"
According to the numbers-crunching FiveThirtyEight, Biden's approval rating is 37.3%.,"right"
Biden's response Thursday night: “How accurate does anybody think the polls are these days?”,"right"
WILMINGTON (AP) - President-elect Joe Biden on Monday cheered news about the promising development of a coronavirus vaccine but cautioned Americans need to be aggressive about mask wearing and social distancing as infections continue to surge around the country.,"right"
The Democrat's transition team also unveiled members of Biden's coronavirus working group tasked with developing his administration's pandemic response - something Biden says he wants to put in motion as soon as he takes office in January.,"right"
As Biden unveiled his coronavirus advisory board - led by former Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler and Yale University public health care expert Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith - Pfizer announced promising results from a vaccine trial.,"right"
"Even if that is achieved, and some Americans are vaccinated later this year, it will be many more months before there is widespread vaccination in this country," Biden said in a statement, noting that the vaccine does not change the "urgent reality" that Americans will have to rely on masking, distancing, and other mitigation in the months ahead.,"right"
Biden is set to take the reins as the pandemic climbs to a new apex.,"right"
Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris received a briefing from the newly-formed advisory board on Monday morning and Biden plans to deliver an address on the pandemic after the meeting.,"right"
While Biden greeted the news with cautious optimism, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to herald the moment with all caps exuberance: "STOCK MARKET UP BIG, VACCINE COMING SOON.,"right"
After declaring victory Saturday, Biden quickly pivoted from a bitter campaign battle to reining in the pandemic that has hit the world's most powerful nation harder than any other.,"right"
Biden announced the members of his advisory board will develop a blueprint for fighting the pandemic.,"right"
Biden pledged during the campaign to make testing free and widely available; to hire thousands of health workers to help implement contact-tracing programs; and to instruct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide clear, expert-informed guidelines, among other proposals.,"right"
But much of what Biden has proposed will take congressional action, and he's certain to face challenges in a closely divided House and Senate.,"right"
During his first remarks as president-elect, Biden said Saturday that his COVID-19 task force will create a plan "built on bedrock science" and "constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern.","right"
There's also hope in the wider medical community that a Biden presidency will help restore U.S. leadership on global public health challenges, including the development and distribution of a vaccine when it becomes available.,"right"
Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, the chief scientist of the World Health Organization, said she was more optimistic that a Biden administration would join Covax, a WHO-led project aimed to help deploy vaccines to the neediest people worldwide, whether they live in rich or poor countries.,"right"
Americans can again order free rapid coronavirus tests by mail, the Biden administration announced Thursday.,"right"
The September revival of the free testing program is in line with the Biden administration’s strategy to respond to the coronavirus as part of a broader public health campaign to protect Americans from respiratory viruses, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), that surge every fall and winter.,"right"
As a result, many estate and tax law practitioners are anticipating the possibility of broad tax law reform proposed by President-elect Biden during his campaign.,"right"
Most notably, President-elect Biden has proposed significantly decreasing the gift and estate tax exemption, resulting in potential increases of gift and estate tax liability for large estates.,"right"
The Biden campaign also proposed eliminating the “step-up in cost basis” benefit, which limits taxation on capital gains by not taxing appreciation that occurs during a decedent's lifetime for certain assets that are transferred at death.,"right"
However, President-elect Biden's campaign platform included a proposed decrease of this exemption to $3.5 million per individual or $7 million for married couples, significantly lower than the pre-TCJA amount.,"right"
Along with this decrease, the Biden campaign proposed an increased tax to those estates in the top tax bracket from 40 percent to 45 percent.,"right"
Additionally, President-elect Biden has not indicated whether his proposal would apply the decreased exemption retroactively to the beginning of 2021, which could impact transfers made in 2021 prior to any legislative action.,"right"
President-elect Biden's campaign also proposed eliminating the step-up in cost basis for capital gains tax.,"right"
It is, of course, impossible to know whether President-elect Biden's campaign proposals will become law during 2021, let alone whether the exact proposals made during the campaign will reflect the actual substance of future legislation.,"right"
Moreover, the timeline of such changes cannot be known, particularly in light of the current pandemic and economic crisis, which will likely be the main focus of the Biden administration's first several months.,"right"
5 flight President Joe Biden took from Washington, D.C., to Delaware, some social media users claimed the plane used for the 25-minute trip proves Biden is not actually the president.,"right"
"Biden's Air Force One is not the same as Trump's Air Force One," reads a post on the social media platform BitChute.,"right"
The C-32 was the plane Biden used for that trip to Delaware.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump on Wednesday agreed to hold two campaign debates in June and September — the first on June 27 hosted by CNN and the second on Sept.,"right"
Biden's campaign instead proposed that media outlets directly organize the debates with the presumptive Democratic and Republican nominees, with the first to be held in late June and the second in September before early voting begins.,"right"
Trump, in a post on his Truth Social site, said he was “Ready and Willing to Debate” Biden at the proposed times.,"right"
Hours later, Biden said he accepted an invitation from CNN to a debate on June 27, adding, “Over to you, Donald.,"right"
Biden said he, too, had received and accepted the invitations.,"right"
Biden's campaign had proposed excluding third-party candidates, such as Robert F.,"right"
“I would strongly recommend more than two debates and, for excitement purposes, a very large venue, although Biden is supposedly afraid of crowds — That’s only because he doesn’t get them,” Trump said.,"right"
He has repeatedly said he will debate Biden “anytime, anywhere, any place,” even proposing the two men face off outside the Manhattan courthouse where he is currently on criminal trial in a hush money case.,"right"
He also has been taunting Biden with an empty lectern at some of his rallies.,"right"
Biden’s campaign has long held a grudge against the nonpartisan commission for failing to evenly apply its rules during the 2020 Biden-Trump matchups — most notably when it didn’t enforce its COVID-19 testing rules on Trump and his entourage — and Biden’s team has held talks with television networks and some Republicans about ways to circumvent the commission’s grip on presidential debates.,"right"
Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon on Wednesday sent a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates to say that Biden’s campaign objected to the fall dates selected by the commission, which come after some Americans begin to vote, repeating a complaint also voiced by the Trump campaign.,"right"
There was little love lost for the commission as well from Trump, who objected to technical issues at his first debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 and was upset after a debate with Biden was canceled in 2020 after the Republican came down with COVID-19.,"right"
Kennedy, in a statement, said “Presidents Trump and Biden are colluding to lock America into a head-to-head match-up that 70% say they do not want.,"right"
The Biden campaign also proposed that the Biden-Trump debates this year be hosted by “any broadcast organization that hosted a Republican Primary debate in 2016 in which Donald Trump participated, and a Democratic primary debate in 2020 in which President Biden participated — so neither campaign can assert that the sponsoring organization is obviously unacceptable: if both candidates have previously debated on their airwaves, then neither could object to such venue.”,"right"
In teeing up the debates, both Biden and Trump traded barbs on social media — each claiming victory the last time they faced-off in 2020.,"right"
“Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020, since then, he hasn’t shown up for a debate,' Biden said in a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter.,"right"
Trump, for his part, said Biden was the “WORST debater I have ever faced — He can’t put two sentences together!”,"right"
Biden indicated again last week that he was preparing to debate, telling reporters as he was leaving a White House event: “Set it up.”,"right"
Social media users recently pointed to a video that includes a blurred presidential seal, retweeted by Vice President Kamala Harris, as proof that Joe Biden isn't actually president.,"right"
The clip shows Biden signing the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act into law, while seated at a desk displaying the presidential seal which appears to be intentionally blurred.,"right"
The DNC has blurred the seal in other clips posted online, including a video shared by Biden, and it's usually obscured in political ads.,"right"
President Joe Biden's $1.75 trillion Build Back Better plan has been criticized because of the chance it could drive up inflation.,"right"
"I expect Biden's bills to push upward on inflation, rather than downward.,"right"
Two recent bills, one signed into law by President Donald Trump and one by President Joe Biden, called for spending more than the $1.75 trillion, 10-year price tag proposed in the Build Back Better plan.,"right"
Trump's Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, passed in March 2020, totaled $2.3 trillion and the American Rescue Plan, signed by Biden in March 2021, cost $1.9 trillion.,"right"
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Joe Biden is trying to sweeten his pitch for more money for Ukraine by mixing in billions of dollars for securing the U.S.-Mexico border in the hope that it will bring more Republicans on board.,"right"
Republicans are loudly critical of Biden's border policies as too lax.,"right"
There are rising numbers of migrants at the border, and Biden has repeatedly said Congress should act to fix outdated immigration laws.,"right"
There's also $1.3 billion requested for regional migration centers outside the U.S., a new effort brokered by the Biden administration to encourage would-be migrants to stay where they are and apply for asylum before crossing the deadly Darien gap between South and Central America.,"right"
He has accused the Biden administration of not providing enough money or resources for the city to process migrants, telling reporters in the summer: "The president and the White House have failed New York City on this issue.","right"
"While we are hopeful the Biden administration will be able to take further action soon, allocating any new funding would require the GOP members in the House to get their act together and do their jobs.","right"
Maura Healey said the money was "urgently needed for states like Massachusetts that are experiencing historic surges in migrant arrivals, and we appreciate the Biden administration's acknowledgement that these funds need to be distributed more equitably.","right"
"But without meaningful and substantive policy changes that will address the #BidenBorderCrisis such aid is in serious jeopardy," he posted on the platform X.,"right"
A year ago when no one worried about face masks and Joe Biden was fighting for his political life in Democratic primaries, his Deputy National Press Secretary Matt Hill worked the phones and coordinated strategy from a bustling Philadelphia campaign office.,"right"
Although the front-runner, Biden faced challenges from his opponents and tough questions about his record.,"right"
But “nothing is more motivating than to show up knowing you're working for a leader who is as respected and accomplished as Joe Biden,” Hill said.,"right"
On Wednesday, the Buffalo Grove native, 26, watched as Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States.,"right"
Hill met Biden on campus at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he served on student government in 2014 and 2015.,"right"
That someone turned out to be Biden.,"right"
Hill organized an event in spring 2015 and Biden's “impassioned speech” grabbed his attention and loyalty.,"right"
“He's had a special impact on my life from that time on,” said Hill, who with college friends gave Biden a campus tour in the vice president's limousine.,"right"
“The first moment you meet Joe Biden you feel like you've known him forever,” he said.,"right"
Hill interned for Biden in 2016, then held communications jobs in the private sector and at Georgetown University.,"right"
He joined Biden's primary campaign in mid-2019 and described a typical day as: “I wake up in the morning and the first thing I do is start reading the news, see what's happened on the morning shows, the cable shows, and the political newsletters.” Then there are policy papers to draft, media calls to handle, breaking news to monitor and react to.,"right"
The early primaries delivered challenges as Biden lost in Iowa and New Hampshire.,"right"
But Hill said the worst moment of the campaign was learning in late 2019 that close friend T.J. Ducklo, Biden's press secretary, has Stage 4 lung cancer.,"right"
Biden and his wife, Jill, made a surprise visit to the Philadelphia office Jan.,"right"
Watching the virtual Democratic National Convention from the suburbs instead of the Wisconsin Center in Milwaukee was bittersweet, Hill said, but he felt Biden's speech was transcendent.,"right"
“Joe Biden's superpower is empathy,” Hill said.,"right"
For Joe Biden, long path to a potentially crucial presidency,"right"
Biden vows to defeat Trump, end US  'season of darkness',"right"
— Prospective jurors in a federal gun case against President Joe Biden’s son Hunter were questioned Monday on their thoughts about gun rights and drug addiction while the first lady watched from the front row of the courtroom in a show of support for her son.,"right"
As the first day of jury selection broke for lunch, Hunter Biden walked over to his mom and leaned over the railing that separates the audience from the trial participants to hug and kiss her on the cheek.,"right"
One prospective juror who was dismissed said she didn’t know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.,"right"
Hunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction.,"right"
Hunter Biden also faces a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes.,"right"
Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.,"right"
This trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs — which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt.,"right"
But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.,"right"
The president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who’s long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized.,"right"
Hunter Biden’s sister, Ashley Biden, was also in court, and his wife, Melissa.,"right"
The case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack.,"right"
His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer.,"right"
Defense attorneys have suggested they may argue that Hunter Biden didn’t see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked “no” to the question on the form.,"right"
If convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.,"right"

Some internet users are claiming a video circulating online shows President Joe Biden giving his used face mask to retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.,"right"
"Confused Biden hands Justice Breyer HIS mask, walks away maskless," read one post which included the clip.,"right"
The full video shows Biden, wearing a black mask, and Breyer, wearing a white mask, before a Jan.,"right"
When he is finished speaking, he seems to leave without the mask, which was on the podium, as he yields the microphone to Biden.,"right"
As Biden speaks, Breyer can be seen removing a white mask from his pocket and putting it on, PolitiFact said.,"right"
Biden keeps the black mask in his hand as he gives closing remarks.,"right"
Biden then leaves the room maskless, with his black mask in hand.,"right"
President Biden’s team continues to believe that tens of millions Americans — perhaps as many as one in every five voters — will cast a ballot for him this year despite their current conviction that he is already too old or not mentally competent to do the job.,"right"
“There is going to be a lot of hay made about ‘up to the job or not,’ without people stopping to say, ‘Is that a vote-driving metric?’” said one Biden campaign pollster in an interview Sunday, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe strategy.,"right"
Biden’s debate debacle last Thursday laid bare the bet, forcing the 81-year old president to admit the following day at a North Carolina rally that he has a diminished capacity for walking and talking.,"right"
“I am going through the same thing myself and I just know it doesn’t get any better,” said Democratic strategist James Carville, 79, one of the most outspoken Democrats concerned about Biden’s continued path.,"right"
But Biden’s team has argued that the concern over Biden’s most basic abilities and competence will not be reflected at the ballot box, both because of Biden’s record and the proportionate voter aversion to former President Donald Trump winning a second term.,"right"
Biden campaign polling since the debate, they say, has confirmed their theory of the case.,"right"
Though some 2020 Biden voters came away from the debate with a more negative view of the president, a large majority of those who were turned off said they were still voting for Biden.,"right"
A significant share of the group also reconsidered their opinion when shown clips from Biden’s Friday rally in North Carolina, where he demonstrated much more energy and declared, “I know how to do this job.”,"right"
“Our job is to show voters that Joe Biden is not just up to the job, but he is currently doing the job that they sent him to do and has a vision for the second term,” Biden pollster Molly Murphy said.,"right"
That renewed effort launched Monday with a new ad, debuted on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, that used footage of Biden’s energetic Friday speech in North Carolina to attack Trump, mixed with footage of the Jan.,"right"
6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, darkened images of Trump, and footage of Biden doing the job of president.,"right"
The ad includes Biden’s admission, “I know I am not a young man.”,"right"
“And I know like millions of Americans know,” Biden bellows at the ad’s conclusion over a cheering crowd, “when you get knocked down, you get back up.”,"right"
From the start of the campaign, Biden’s team has painted a relatively dim view of how the election would unfold.,"right"
Their strategy has hinged on forcing Americans to choose between two men for whom they have serious concerns — Trump, whose political approach has been a consistent loser in elections since 2016, and Biden, who enters the race with historically low approval ratings and unprecedented concerns about his abilities.,"right"
A June Gallup poll before the debate found that 67% of the country believed Biden is “too old to be president” — twice as high a share as the concerns that faced the late Sens.,"right"
A CBS News/YouGov poll after the Thursday debate found that 72% said Biden “does not have the mental and cognitive health to be president.”,"right"
Those numbers are not contested by the Biden campaign, though advisers point out that significant shares of voters also have concerns about Trump.,"right"
The numbers lay bare a central challenge for the Biden campaign: If he only receives votes from those who find him competent, he would receive support from less than a third of the electorate — far behind the winning margin he needs, even with a significant third-party candidate lowering the share of the vote total he needs to win.,"right"
Major donors have expressed alarm, saying they recognized in Biden’s performance some of the deterioration they have observed in smaller meetings and donor events.,"right"
Elected Democratic leaders, for their part, have mostly withheld public judgment or expressed support for Biden’s candidacy as they await polling to settle.,"right"
Even Trump advisers have discussed the likelihood that it will take until after the July Fourth holiday to know just how much damage was done to Biden.,"right"
Biden’s advisers have long pointed to those results to argue that presidential approval is less determinative in contests where Trump’s politics are at issue, but they have not tested that with Biden on the ballot.,"right"
The rosier scenario holds that much of the concern over Biden’s age was already baked into the electorate before Thursday’s debate.,"right"
While Biden’s performance may make winning over new concerned voters more difficult, it is unlikely to reduce his vote share by much.,"right"
Geoff Garin, another Biden campaign pollster, said in a campaign memo Saturday that there had been no change in the vote choice in two battleground polls conducted after the debate.,"right"
“The critical marginal voters — the swing voters and the marginal turnout targets on both sides — already thought that Joe Biden was the person who showed up at that debate,” said Dmitri Mehlhorn, a high-dollar donor adviser and Democratic strategist who has been working with independent groups to support Biden.,"right"
Biden’s campaign and outside allies still plan to spend hundreds of millions of dollars over the coming months to highlight parts of Trump’s record and agenda that turn off these same voters.,"right"
“The ‘Debate’ was a visual representation of the Biden presidency: Weak, Failed and Dishonest,” Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita posted Sunday on social media.,"right"
What is not disputed is that Biden was behind where he needed to be when the debate began, and the aftermath has not helped his situation.,"right"
Rather than the referendum on Trump that Biden hopes to create, the Democratic Party is now consumed with debate over Biden’s merits and limitations.,"right"
WASHINGTON - The General Services Administration ascertained Monday that President-elect Joe Biden is the "apparent winner" of the Nov.,"right"
3 election, clearing the way for the start of the transition from President Donald Trump's administration and allowing Biden to coordinate with federal agencies on plans for taking over on Jan.,"right"
Administrator Emily Murphy made the determination after Trump efforts to subvert the vote failed across battleground states, citing, "recent developments involving legal challenges and certifications of election results." Michigan certified Biden's victory Monday, and a federal judge in Pennsylvania tossed a Trump campaign lawsuit on Saturday seeking to prevent certification in that state.,"right"
Yohannes Abraham, the executive director of the Biden transition, said in a statement that the decision "is a needed step to begin tackling the challenges facing our nation, including getting the pandemic under control and our economy back on track.","right"
Murphy, a Trump appointee, had faced bipartisan criticism for failing to begin the transition process sooner, preventing Biden's team from working with career agency officials on plans for his administration, including in critical national security and public health areas.,"right"
I was never directly or indirectly pressured by any Executive Branch official - including those who work at the White House or GSA - with regard to the substance or timing of my decision," Murphy wrote in a letter to Biden.,"right"
Lamar Alexander, who has repeatedly called for the transition to begin, released a new statement Monday saying that Trump should "put the country first" and help Biden's administration succeed.,"right"
Portman, a senior member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, also said Biden should receive high-level briefings on national security and the coronavirus vaccine distribution plan.,"right"
Meanwhile, more than 160 business leaders asked Murphy to immediately acknowledge Biden as president-elect and begin the transition to a new administration.,"right"
"Every additional day that is wasted is a day that the safety, health, and well-being of the American people is imperiled as the incoming Biden-Harris administration is blocked from fully preparing for the coronavirus pandemic, our nation's dire economic crisis, and our national security.","right"
20, 2021, but in the likely event that Joe Biden becomes our next president, it is in the national interest that the transition is seamless and that America is ready on Day One of a new administration for the challenges we face,″ Portman wrote in an op-ed calling for the transition to begin.,"right"
Murphy's ascertainment will free up money for the transition and clear the way for Biden's team to begin placing transition personnel at federal agencies.,"right"
Trump administration officials had said they would not give Biden the classified presidential daily briefing on intelligence matters until the GSA makes the ascertainment official.,"right"
"Unfortunately, every day lost to the delayed ascertainment was a missed opportunity for the outgoing administration to help President-elect Joe Biden prepare to meet our country's greatest challenges.,"right"

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Donald Trump unleashed a barrage of attack lines Wednesday against his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he called his “new victim to defeat” and accused of deceiving the public about President Joe Biden's ability to run for a second term.,"right"
The rally in Charlotte, North Carolina marked his first public campaign event since Biden dropped out of the 2024 matchup and Harris became the Democrats' likely nominee.,"right"
The rally concluded minutes before Biden addressed the nation to explain he dropped his reelection bid to “pass the torch” to Harris, who is 22 years younger than him.,"right"
Trump has ramped up his criticism of the vice president since Biden’s abrupt departure, calling Harris “the same as Biden but much more radical.”,"right"
He blamed her for what he portrays as the Biden administration’s failures, particularly security along the U.S.-Mexico border.,"right"
Trump also accused Harris of being just as responsible for Biden’s policies at the U.S.-Mexico border, which saw illegal crossing arrests reach record highs at the end of 2023 and repeated his pledge to conduct mass deportations with the help of local police.,"right"
Trump has hedged on plans for an expected debate with Harris, first saying that he wanted Fox News, not ABC, to host the matchup he had originally scheduled for September with Biden.,"right"
On Tuesday, Trump appeared to tweak that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he'd like to debate Harris “more than once” but not committing to appearing at the debate currently on the books and saying he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice, not Harris.,"right"
Quietly, Republicans have spoken about how subbing Harris in for Biden nullifies a portion of their party's argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor.,"right"
At 81, Biden would have been the oldest presidential nominee heading into a general election.,"right"
North Carolina is a state Trump carried in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won.,"right"
Trump stumped heavily in North Carolina even as the COVID-19 pandemic wore on, while Biden largely kept off the physical campaign trail and did not personally visit the state in the last 16 days of the election.,"right"
Biden held a campaign event in Raleigh the day after his disastrous June debate with Trump.,"right"
22 to accept the Democratic nomination for president in place of Joe Biden, the incumbent’s withdrawal from the 2024 campaign offers more than an improved opportunity for his party to keep the White House.,"right"
Until Sunday, the likely themes of this year’s presidential race would have found Democrats portraying Donald Trump as a narcissistic felon congenitally unfit to lead the nation and Republicans ridiculing Biden as a frail and senile dotard bereft of the faculties needed to run the country.,"right"
Biden rebuilt a faltering economy with historic gains in employment and economic activity.,"right"
We do not feel unreserved glee at the departure of Joe Biden from the top of the Democratic ticket, but we are comforted that his absence presents the opportunity for a more meaningful debate and more reasoned discussion about the issues we will face over the next four years.,"right"

What this is about is not Joe Biden doing “the good as job as I know I can do.” No one doubts that Joe Biden will do his best.,"right"
Biden himself has said that.,"right"
And it will be Joe Biden's fault.,"right"
Joe Biden says he will not let 90 minutes undo three and a half years of successful work.,"right"
If Biden were trying to prove he's up to the challenges of being president, why did he need his staff to write the questions for the two interviews on the radio he did after the debate as part of his failed effort to rehabilitate himself?,"right"
What that episode revealed is what the press has finally begun reporting: that, as a stunner of an article in New York Magazine reported, there has been a kind of unholy “conspiracy” among Biden's staff and the press who follow him, to hide his decline from us.,"right"
Biden is under a microscope, his every stumble is going to be covered, and it's not going to be pretty.,"right"

But Joe Biden is convinced that even if the chattering class that used to support him has turned against him, he's going to win.,"right"
What Biden needs, and what he deserves, is straight talk and the honest truth from people who know how to win elections, from elected officials and party leaders and seasoned strategists who are saying to each other what his family is never going to say to him.,"right"
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is commuting the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic and is pardoning 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes.,"right"
Biden said he would be taking more steps in the weeks ahead and would continue to review clemency petitions.,"right"
“America was built on the promise of possibility and second chances,” Biden said in a statement.,"right"
Biden is under pressure from advocacy groups to pardon broad swaths of people, including those on federal death row, before the Trump administration takes over in January.,"right"
Others are advocating for Biden to commute the sentences of federal death row prisoners.,"right"
Biden had said on the campaign trail in 2020 that he wanted to end the death penalty but he never did, and now, with Trump coming back into office, it’s likely executions will resume.,"right"
More pardons are coming before Biden leaves office on Jan.,"right"

Before pardoning his son, Biden had repeatedly pledged not to do so.,"right"
ATLANTA — With President Joe Biden ending his reelection bid and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, Democrats now must navigate a shift that is unprecedented this late in an election year.,"right"
What was supposed to be a coronation for Biden now becomes an open contest in which nearly 4,700 delegates will be responsible for picking a new standard-bearer to challenge Republican Donald Trump in the fall.,"right"
The path ahead is neither easy nor obvious, even with Biden endorsing Harris.,"right"
Can Biden redirect his delegates?,"right"
Biden won every state primary and caucus earlier this year and only lost the territory of American Samoa.,"right"
Current party rules do not permit Biden to pass them to another candidate.,"right"
With Biden stepping aside, Democrats technically start with an open convention.,"right"
Even before Biden announced his decision, Democrats floated California Gov.,"right"
Given how important Black voters -— and Black women especially -— were to Biden’s nomination and his choice of Harris as running mate, it would be risky, to say the least, for Democrats to pass her over for a white nominee.,"right"
Democrats already faced historical headwinds before Biden's withdrawal.,"right"
Democrats could even go forward with their plans for an early virtual vote — a move they’d planned to make sure Biden was selected ahead of Ohio’s general election ballot deadline.,"right"
What happens to Biden’s campaign money?,"right"
Biden’s campaign recently reported $91 million cash on hand.,"right"
Campaign finance experts agree generally that Harris could control all those funds since the campaign was set up in her name as well as Biden’s.,"right"
If Democrats do nominate someone other than Harris, party accounts could still benefit the nominee, but the Biden-Harris account would have more restrictions.,"right"
As Joe Biden was traveling to Delaware following a Wisconsin campaign stop earlier this month, social media posts claimed the president was in distress.,"right"
My source says that Joe Biden is currently experiencing a medical emergency on Air Force One as I type this.,"right"

White House spokesperson Andrew Bates took to X to claim the report of Biden having a medical issue during the flight is “100% false.”,"right"
When the plane landed, video posted by Forbes Breaking News shows Biden exiting the plane on his own, descending the stairs, pointing, saluting, speaking with a member of the military and answering a reporter’s question.,"right"
There were no reports from that group that Biden was in the midst of a medical emergency.,"right"
President Biden’s faltering performance in last week’s debate has raised new concerns among allies already worried about the possibility of a second Trump presidency as they head to Washington in coming days for a U.S.-hosted NATO summit.,"right"
An event that the White House anticipated would project Biden’s global leadership and deliver a foreign policy victory at a key campaign moment - less than a week before the Republican National Convention - now has taken on new meaning.,"right"
On Wednesday, Biden’s national security team was preparing his remarks - known in alliance parlance as “interventions” - for the main summit plenary meetings and firming up a schedule for bilateral sessions with individual government heads on the sidelines.,"right"
But the debate stumbles have amplified existing apprehension - shared by many alliance members - that Biden’s reelection campaign is in trouble and that they risk a return to the troubled years of Donald Trump’s disdain for NATO, insults to his fellow Western leaders and praise of adversaries such as Russian President Vladimir Putin.,"right"
“What they’re worried about is Trump, not Biden,” suggested a White House official, one of several U.S. and foreign officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic and security issues.,"right"
A major question is whether Biden can navigate the complicated web of interactions over the three-day event that will involve nearly 40 leaders, their entourages, a swirl of complicated one-on-one meetings and the pressures of being the most important NATO leader at a moment when any misstep could spell political doom.,"right"
Biden administration officials said there had been no thought of limiting the president’s exposure at the summit and noted that a solo news conference that had been penciled in on early agenda drafts has now been firmly scheduled.,"right"
In the wake of the rising turmoil unleashed by the debate, a senior official from one NATO country said the summit was a welcome moment to assess Biden in the flesh and make plans accordingly.,"right"
While the 75th anniversary NATO summit is designed as a show of strength to alliance rivals, questions about Biden’s health have already posed a major distraction that could undermine summit goals, analysts said.,"right"
Just as it has dismissed the debate as a “bad night” for Biden and touted domestic policy accomplishments over the past three years, the White House this week focused attention on what it considers NATO’s successes during Biden’s term, from unity and support for Ukraine and the admission of Sweden and Finland.,"right"
In response to a barrage of questions from reporters about Biden’s mental acuity and physical stamina, Jean-Pierre pointed to foreign leaders, who “have seen the president personally up close for the past three years,” she said.,"right"
As proof, she noted that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, in an interview on the sidelines of last month’s Group of Seven meeting in Italy, praised Biden as “one of the most experienced politicians in the world” and “a man who knows exactly what he is doing.”,"right"
But the offering of a few foreign leader testimonials seemed to underline the concerns expressed by others at home and abroad as Biden moves into the spotlight and seeks to project both domestic vigor and international power.,"right"
Ivo Daalder, who served as U.S. ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration, said that the summit in many ways will play to Biden’s strengths, presenting him with opportunities to rub elbows with friendly leaders and be at the center of attention as other leaders make requests of the United States.,"right"
Also playing in the president’s favor in what will be a closely scrutinized event, he said, is the widespread fear of Trump’s return, making Biden the person who stands between them and the potential for drama and even ruin of the alliance.,"right"
“Everyone will hope that the next NATO meeting will be with him, too,” he said of Biden.,"right"

Biden joined members of Congress and Takai's family at a memorial service in the U.S. Capitol to honor the Democratic lawmaker, who was serving his first term representing Hawaii in the House when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.,"right"
He said that despite Takai's own grim diagnosis, the lawmaker offered Biden condolences about his son Beau, who died in May 2015 at age 46 after battling brain cancer.,"right"
Biden called the congressman courageous and told his wife and two children to keep his memory close.,"right"
"The only thing I have observed is, deep in your broken heart the only way to get through it is to hang on to each other, hold each other," said Biden, whose words elicited an emotional response from many in attendance.,"right"
"I promise you the day will come when Mark's memory brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye," Biden said.,"right"
Biden has occasionally talked about his grief after Beau's death.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that he was immediately rushing badly needed weaponry to Ukraine as he signed into law a $95 billion war aid measure that also included assistance for Israel, Taiwan and other global hotspots.,"right"
The announcement marked an end to the long, painful battle with Republicans in Congress over urgently needed assistance for Ukraine, with Biden promising that U.S. weapons shipment would begin making the way into Ukraine “in the next few hours.”,"right"
“We rose to the moment, we came together, and we got it done," Biden said a White House event to announce the bill signing.,"right"
But significant damage has been done to the Biden administration’s effort to help Ukraine repel Russia’s invasion during the funding impasse that dates back to August, when the Democratic president made his first emergency spending request for Ukraine aid.,"right"
Biden immediately approved sending Ukraine $1 billion in military assistance, the first tranche from about $61 billion allocated for Ukraine.,"right"
The Biden administration and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have called the social media site a growing national security concern, which ByteDance denies.,"right"
Biden said Israel must ensure the humanitarian aid for Palestinians in bill reaches Gaza “without delay.”,"right"
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg quickly called out Trump for putting “American and European soldiers at increased risk.” Biden days later called Trump's comments "dangerous" and “un-American” and accused Trump of playing into Putin's hands.,"right"
Biden, the day after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv following Hamas militants' stunning Oct.,"right"
Biden in August requested more than $20 billion to keep aid flowing into Ukraine, but the money was stripped out of a must-pass spending bill even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Washington to make a personal plea for continued U.S. backing.,"right"
Biden during his congratulatory call with Johnson urged him to quickly pass Ukraine aid and began a months-long, largely behind-the-scenes effort to bring the matter to a vote.,"right"
In private conversations with Johnson, Biden and White House officials leaned into the stakes for Europe if Ukraine were to fall to Russia.,"right"
On explicit orders from Biden, White House officials also avoided directly attacking Johnson over the stalled aid.,"right"
Biden had success finding common ground with Republicans earlier in his term to win the passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, legislation to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and an expansion of federal health care services for veterans exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits.,"right"
Biden praised Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying in the end they “stepped up and did the right thing.”,"right"
“History will remember this moment," Biden said.,"right"
At frustrating moments during the negotiations, Biden urged his aides to “just keep talking, keep working,” according to the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal discussions.,"right"
All the while, senior Biden officials frequently updated McConnell as well as key Republican committee leaders, including Reps.,"right"
Biden lamented that the package did not include money to bolster U.S. border security.,"right"
Republicans, however, rejected the proposal at the urging of Trump, who did not want to give Biden the win on an issue that’s been an albatross for the Democratic administration.,"right"
“It should have been included in this bill,” Biden said.,"right"
The Wednesday meeting between Joe Biden and Donald Trump slightly overlapped with the Classroom to Career Summit that took place that morning in the East Room.,"right"
The local attendees saw Biden speak ahead of his scheduled meeting with Trump, who attendees say they did not see during their visit.,"right"
The invitation — from Biden and First Lady Jill Biden — follows the latter’s visit to Rolling Meadows High School in November 2022 and the subsequent invite of student Kate Foley of Arlington Heights to be her guest at the State of the Union address in February 2023.,"right"
The Biden administration’s emphasis on educational pathways — leading to jobs in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing and other fields — vibes with District 214’s Career Pathways program, which provides students a chance to explore various careers through specialized courses and workplace experiences.,"right"
After a round of applause from the 200 attendees — a group that included community college presidents, workforce development leaders and other officials — Jill Biden looked over to her husband and said, laughing, “Well, Joe, that started our day off right, didn’t it?”,"right"
Days later, invitees learned the Biden-Trump meeting would also take place Wednesday.,"right"
The Bidens addressed the roomful of educators between 10:09 and 10:33 a.m. ET; the outgoing Democratic president’s meeting with the former and soon-to-be-president was roughly between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.,"right"
As Biden met with Trump, the secretaries of the departments of Education, Transportation, Labor and Commerce addressed the room.,"right"
If you want to explain to a puzzled, left-leaning writer like The Atlantic's Annie Lowrey why most voters this year rate the economy during former President Donald Trump's term more favorably than the economy during President Joe Biden's, you might start with a pair of simple charts.,"right"
Lowrey said the Biden years have seen “the strongest economy the United States has ever experienced.” She cited an unemployment rate below 4%, wage growth higher “than it was at any point during the Obama administration,” and “stronger pay increases than any president since Richard Nixon.” Inflation, she noted defensively, “has cooled off considerably.”,"right"
All well and good, and you can hear similar thoughts from Democratic economists and Biden administration spokespeople, together, sometimes, with suggestions that many voters are, well, just not knowledgeable or sophisticated enough to appreciate the bounty the administration's policies have produced.,"right"
In response, look at the pair of charts tweeted by Republican consultant Patrick Ruffini as evidence of “how Joe Biden is losing the election with an economy like this.” They come from an article in last weekend's Wall Street Journal by Greg Ip and Rosie Ettenheim.,"right"
Total household net worth rose 19% through Biden's first three years in office, according to Federal Reserve data — not much less than the 23% through Trump's first three years.”,"right"
In contrast, the line showing real household net worth during the Biden presidency shoots downward in summer 2022, following and perhaps sustaining the plunge of Biden's job approval rating after the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan.,"right"
For the total Biden presidency so far, Ip and Ettenheim reported, it is up a barely perceptible 0.7%.,"right"
No wonder “Bidenomics” is a hard sell.,"right"
Most of the Biden-encouraged prosecutions of Trump have been postponed, perhaps indefinitely, and the kangaroo court proceeding in Manhattan is discrediting not the defendant but his prosecutors.,"right"
On this, as on the economy, Biden strategists are better at fooling themselves than fooling the voters.,"right"
WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden went to Chicago on June 28 to give a landmark speech on "Bidenomics," only to learn in private during the trip about a soon-to-close auto factory, news that was a challenge to his vision for the country.,"right"
The prospect of a shuttered Stellantis plant in the small city of Belvidere became an immediate priority for Biden.,"right"
On Thursday, Biden will visit Belvidere to showcase that auto plant, which has reopened as part of the settlement of a targeted strike by the United Auto Workers union.,"right"
The resolution of the strike was an early victory for what Biden says is a worker-centered economy.,"right"
In polls, U.S. adults have consistently given Biden low marks on the economy after a burst of inflation as the pandemic began to recede.,"right"
But by speaking at factories and union halls, Biden is also trying to reach disaffected blue-collar voters who found a voice in former President Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner for his party's 2024 nomination.,"right"
Biden argues that innovations within the auto sector such as EVs should not lead to layoffs and factory closures.,"right"
Trump has said that the rise of EVs backed by the Biden administration will cause factory job losses.,"right"
Biden has a slightly better record on auto industry jobs than Trump.,"right"
There are nearly 1.1 million auto manufacturing jobs under Biden.,"right"
On Thursday, Biden will meet with UAW President Shawn Fain and Gov.,"right"
The UAW has yet to endorse Biden for the 2024 election, unlike most other large unions.,"right"
Biden took the step of joining workers on the picket line, a presidential first.,"right"
In calls that White House officials had with Stellantis, the company was never pushed to open the Belvidere factory, but Biden raised the matter.,"right"
The headline on this story has been corrected to reflect that Biden is not going to the plant.,"right"
WASHINGTON — A defiant President Joe Biden vowed Wednesday to keep running for reelection, rejecting growing pressure from Democrats to withdraw after a disastrous debate performance raised questions about his readiness to keep campaigning, much less win in November.,"right"
Two Democratic lawmakers have called on Biden to exit the race while a leading ally publicly suggested how the party might choose someone else.,"right"
“Let me say this as clearly as I possibly can as simply and straightforward as I can: I am running … no one’s pushing me out,” Biden said on a call with staffers from his reelection campaign.,"right"
In his private conversations, Biden was focused on efforts to course correct from his rocky debate and on the threat that, in his view, former President Donald Trump poses to the country, as he scoured for feedback on what went wrong last Thursday in Atlanta and took responsibility for his performance.,"right"
Chris Coons, D-Del., who spoke with Biden on Tuesday, said in an interview with The Associated Press.,"right"
Coons, the president's closest ally on Capitol Hill, said Biden clearly understood the urgency, the difficulty and the importance of the election, as the senator advised that the president do more unscripted, open-ended events to restore confidence in his candidacy.,"right"
The two also spoke about Biden's schedule and its impact on his political efforts, particularly as he balances that task with critical governing tasks such as the NATO summit in Washington next week.,"right"
Biden's efforts to pull multiple levers to salvage his faltering reelection include his impromptu appearance with campaign aides, private conversations with senior lawmakers, a weekend blitz of travel and a network television interview.,"right"
Biden met for more than hour at the White House on Wednesday night, in person and virtually, with more than 20 Democratic governors,  including Illinois Gov.,"right"
Afterward, they described the conversation as “candid” but said they were standing behind Biden despite being concerned about a Trump victory in November.,"right"
He added that, in the meeting, Biden “was very clear that he’s in this to win.”,"right"
Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., told The New York Times that though he backs Biden as long as he is a candidate, this “is an opportunity to look elsewhere” and what Biden “needs to do is shoulder the responsibility for keeping that seat — and part of that responsibility is to get out of this race.”,"right"
Senior advisers say they believe the 81-year-old Biden may have mere days to mount a convincing display of his fitness for office before his party’s panic over his debate performance and anger about his response boils over, according to two people with knowledge who insisted on anonymity to more freely discuss strategy.,"right"
Despite such reassuring sentiments, a major Democratic donor, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, also called on the president to exit the race, saying, “Biden needs to step aside to allow a vigorous Democratic leader to beat Trump and keep us safe and prosperous.” The statement was first reported by The New York Times.,"right"
Jim Clyburn, a longtime Biden friend and confidant, saying he'd back a “mini-primary” in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention next month if Biden were to leave the race.,"right"
And even as other Democratic allies have remained quiet since Thursday’s debate, there is a growing private frustration about the Biden campaign’s response to his disastrous debate performance at a crucial moment in the campaign — particularly in Biden waiting several days to do direct damage control with senior members of his own party.,"right"
One Democratic aide said the lacking response has been worse than the debate performance itself, saying lawmakers who support Biden want to see him directly combating the concerns about his stamina in front of reporters and voters.,"right"
Most Democratic lawmakers are taking a wait-and-see approach with Biden, though, holding out for a better idea of how the situation plays out through new polling and Biden’s scheduled ABC News interview, according to Democratic lawmakers who requested anonymity to speak bluntly about the president.,"right"
Lloyd Doggett, who called on Biden to leave the race this week, shopped around his move for support from other Democratic lawmakers, he had no takers and eventually issued a statement on his own, according to a person familiar with the effort granted anonymity to discuss it.,"right"
But there was also a sense that the waiting period will soon expire if Biden does not step up his outreach to Capitol Hill or prove otherwise that he’s up to the job.,"right"
Some suggested Harris was emerging as the favorite to replace Biden if he were to withdraw, although those involved in private discussions acknowledge that Govs.,"right"
Even as pressure around Biden mounted, he and Harris made a surprise appearance on an all-staff reelection campaign call and offered a pep talk.,"right"
They stressed how important it was to beat Trump, the presumptive nominee, in November and returned to Biden’s previous post-debate vow that when he gets knocked down, he gets up again.,"right"
“Just as we beat Donald Trump in 2020, we’re going to beat him again in 2024,” said Biden, who told participants that he would not be dragged out of the race.,"right"
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked during her briefing with reporters whether Biden would consider stepping down.,"right"
“I cannot lay out something that would change the president’s mind,” Jean-Pierre said about Biden continuing to seek a second term.,"right"
Still, Democrats are unsatisfied with the explanations of Biden’s debate performance, from both White House staff and the president himself.,"right"
And there is a deeper frustration among some in the party who feel that Biden should have handled questions about his stumbling debate performance much sooner and that he has put them in a difficult position by staying in the race.,"right"
The Leadership Now Project, a group of business executives, academics and thought leaders, said in a letter that the “threat of a second Trump term” is great enough that Biden should “pass the torch of this year’s presidential nomination to the next generation of highly capable Democrats.”,"right"
Trump’s campaign issued a statement noting that “every Democrat” now calling on the president “to quit was once a supporter of Biden.”,"right"
Trump had a slight lead over Biden in two polls of voters conducted after last week's debate.,"right"
One poll, conducted by SSRS for CNN, found that three-quarters of voters — including more than half Democratic voters — said the party has a better chance of winning the presidency in November with a candidate other than Biden.,"right"
About 7 in 10 voters, and 45% of Democrats, said Biden’s physical and mental ability is a reason to vote against him, according to the CNN/SSRS poll.,"right"
And about 6 in 10 voters, including about one-quarter of Democrats, said reelecting Biden would be a risky choice for the country rather than a safe one, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll.,"right"
That poll found that Democrats were split on whether Biden should remain the nominee.,"right"
Biden campaign pollster Molly Murphy said “today’s polling doesn’t fundamentally change the course of the race.”,"right"
In a further effort to boost morale, Biden chief of staff Jeff Zients urged White House aides during an all-staff meeting to tune out the “noise” and focus on the task of governing.,"right"
Biden himself began making personal outreach on his own, speaking privately with senior Democratic lawmakers such as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Coons and Clyburn.,"right"
President Joe Biden delivered his valedictory address to the Democratic National Convention on Monday night, as his decision to end his reelection bid released newfound energy within his party with Vice President Kamala Harris ′ elevation to the top of the ticket.,"right"
After 52 years rising to the pinnacle of influence within his party, Biden, 81, received a hero’s welcome for the act of stepping aside for Harris, weeks after many in his party were pressuring him to drop his bid for reelection.,"right"
A visibly emotional Biden was greeted by a more than four-minute-long ovation and chants of “Thank you Joe.”,"right"
Speaking clearly and energetically, Biden appeared to relish the chance to defend his record, advocate for his vice president and go on the attack against Trump.,"right"
His delivery was more reminiscent of the Biden who won in 2020 than the mumbling and sometimes incoherent one-time candidate whose debate performance against Trump in June sparked the downfall of his reelection campaign.,"right"
Biden, in his remarks, repeated his 2020 theme that “we’re in a battle for the very soul of America,” and pressed the case for why Harris and her running mate Tim Walz were best prepared to wage it.,"right"
“Because of you, we’ve had the most extraordinary four years of progress ever, period,” Biden declared.,"right"
Harris made an unannounced appearance onstage as the convention's prime-time program began Monday evening to thank Biden for his leadership, and watched his remarks from the stands.,"right"
Biden's speech, billed as the marquee event of the evening, was pushed into late night as the convention program lagged more than an hour behind schedule.,"right"
The president recalled the 2017 “unite the right” rally, when torch-carrying white supremacists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, an episode he cites as cementing his decision to run for president in 2020 despite his ongoing grief over the death of his son Beau Biden.,"right"
“I could not stay on the sidelines,” Biden said.,"right"
Biden celebrated the successes from his administration, including a massive boost in infrastructure spending and a cap on the price of insulin.,"right"
Not even a month ago, Democrats were riven over foreign policy, political strategy and Biden himself, who was holding on after a disastrous debate by claiming he had a better chance than any other Democrat — including Harris — of beating Trump.,"right"
On Monday, Biden insisted he did not harbor any ill will to the many voices in the arena before him who had pushed him to the exits, and called on the party to unite around Harris.,"right"
Accusing Trump of “bowing down” to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Biden said, “I never have and I promise you Kamala Harris will never do it.”,"right"
First lady Jill Biden alluded to her husband's wrenching decision to leave the race in her remarks minutes before Biden took the stage.,"right"
Still, there was little question that the Democratic Party would almost certainly have been in a far worse state if Biden had continued to cling to his campaign, despite growing concerns about his mental and physical acuity after struggling to complete sentences during his debate against Trump.,"right"
Democrats took turns praising Biden's leadership and his choice in Harris to succeed him.,"right"
“I’ve never know a more compassionate man than Joe Biden,” said his longtime confidant Delaware Sen.,"right"
They tried to connect both Biden and Harris to what the party sees as the governing pair's most popular accomplishments: leading the country out of the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, pushing for massive investments in the country's infrastructure, working to lower health care costs and promoting clean energy.,"right"
Jim Clyburn, whose 2020 endorsement was critical to Biden winning that primary.,"right"
He added that one of Biden's best decisions was “selecting Kamala Harris as his vice president and endorsing her to succeed him.”,"right"
Clinton also saluted Biden for stepping aside, saying, “Now we are writing a new chapter in America’s story.”,"right"
Outside the arena, thousands of protesters descended on Chicago to decry the Biden-Harris administration’s support for the Israeli war effort.,"right"
Biden acknowledged the protests outside the convention and inside the arena as he spoke, saying, “Those protesters out in the street have a point.,"right"
United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain led the crowd in chanting that “Trump is a scab” as he credited Biden and Harris with standing by striking autoworkers last year.,"right"
SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) - Joe Biden cast President Donald Trump on Wednesday as a fraudulent populist whose tax policies, economic stewardship and erratic leadership have hurt U.S. workers and betrayed voters in the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania.,"right"
After scrapping with fellow Democrats for weeks, Biden returned to his hometown of Scranton to focus on his ultimate foe: Trump.,"right"
"This administration has no idea what hard-working, decent, ordinary Americans are going through," Biden said of middle-class struggle in a growing but uneven economy.,"right"
"Go back to your old neighborhoods and ask them how they're doing," Biden said, lamenting that the rising cost of health care, college and housing deny the "breathing room" that should define middle-class security.,"right"
Trump appeared later in the day in Pittsburgh, at the opposite end of the state, but made no mention of Biden.,"right"
The speech, which was billed as an economic policy address, is the type of forum where Biden often has his strongest moments in a campaign that has contended with verbal missteps and inconsistent debate performances.,"right"
But it's becoming increasingly difficult for Biden or any other Democratic White House hopefuls to compete with the daily cacophony of Washington as Trump rails against the House impeachment inquiry.,"right"
Biden was reminded of that on the eve of his speech.,"right"
When Biden's campaign joined the resulting chorus of critics , the president's re-election campaign revived a 1998 video of then-Sen.,"right"
Biden using the same "lynching" metaphor when discussing impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.,"right"
Biden tweeted an apology for his choice of words Tuesday night, but made no mention of the matter Wednesday in Scranton.,"right"
Biden recalled stories from his childhood in Scranton, including his father's "long walk" up the stairs of their home to tell 10-year-old "Joey" that the family had to move to Delaware because the elder Biden had lost his job.,"right"
Turning to Trump, he said, "I think the longest walk his father ever made was to drop off $400 million in his trust account," Biden said.,"right"
Biden argues that he's the Democrat best positioned to defeat Trump by reassembling President Barack Obama's winning coalition to reclaim some working-class whites who sided with Trump while also reversing Democrats' decline from 2012 among non-white voters in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee.,"right"
Biden railed against escalating corporate profits and salaries for CEOs. He held up the decades after World War II, when wage increases reflected the rise in U.S. productivity, in contrast to the last 40 years, when inflation-adjusted wages remained relatively flat for all but the highest wage-earners, and the investment class amassed fortunes reminiscent of the Gilded Age.,"right"
That span covers nearly all of Biden's career as a U.S. senator and vice president.,"right"
In using the economy as an argument against Trump, Biden also indirectly highlighted differences with progressive Democratic rivals Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.,"right"
Biden touted tax changes that would treat capital gains on investments essentially as wages - a move that would bring tax increases for the wealthiest Americans.,"right"
Biden also pitched his public option health insurance plan as competition against private insurers.,"right"
Biden called for tuition-free two-year college and technical training.,"right"
Even as Biden knocked corporate excess Wednesday, he slipped in a caveat: "I think corporations can do a lot of good things.","right"
For at least one member of the hometown crowd, Biden struck the right notes.,"right"
"All these young people want drastic change," said Elaine Sparko, a 65-year-old retired teacher who came to hear Biden.,"right"
WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden told Native American nations gathered for a summit Wednesday that his administration was working to heal the wrongs of the past as he signed an executive order that seeks to make it easier for Indigenous peoples to access federal funding, and have greater autonomy over how to spend it.,"right"
Biden also threw his support behind a request to allow Haudenosaunee Confederacy to compete under its own flag in the 2028 Olympics in lacrosse, a sport they invented.,"right"
Biden said the actions at the summit were "key steps" that would help usher in an new era of tribal sovereignty.,"right"
"It's hard work to heal the wrongs of the past and change the course, and move forward," Biden said.,"right"
Yurok Tribal Council Member Phillip Williams described Biden's speech as inspirational.,"right"
Biden signed the order as members of his administration and tribal nation leaders stood behind him on stage at the Department of the Interior.,"right"
In July, the Biden administration announced $120 million in grant funding for tribes in the U.S. to boost their resiliency to climate change.,"right"
Biden hosted the summit in person last year and virtually the year before.,"right"
This year, White House officials said, the goal was to provide an opportunity for tribal leaders to have more meaningful conversations directly with members of Biden's Cabinet.,"right"
Biden said he was throwing his support behind the effort to allow the confederacy to play under its own flag at the Los Angeles Olympics.,"right"
"Their circumstances are unique," Biden said.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is requesting nearly $100 billion in emergency disaster aid after Hurricanes Helene and Milton, and other natural disasters, telling lawmakers that the money is “urgently needed.”,"right"
Biden said he has met firsthand with those harmed by the storms and he heard what residents and businesses needed from the federal government.,"right"
"Additional resources are critical to continue to support these communities,” Biden said.,"right"
Biden said the fund would face a shortfall this budget year without additional money.,"right"
Biden is seeking $2 billion for that program.,"right"
With many Republicans campaigning on reducing federal spending, there could be some debate about portions of Biden's request.,"right"
The Senate Appropriations Committee is expected to hear Wednesday from the heads of several of the government agencies that would receive funding through Biden's request.,"right"
Biden noted that Congress had provided more than $90 billion in aid after Hurricane Katrina nearly two decades ago, and more than $50 billion after Hurricane Sandy in 2013.,"right"
“Just as the Congress acted then, it is our sworn duty now to deliver the necessary resources to ensure that everyone in communities reeling from Hurricanes Helene and Milton — and those still recovering from previous disasters — have the Federal resources they need and deserve,” Biden wrote.,"right"
LOS ANGELES  — Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to federal tax charges Thursday in a surprise move that spares President Joe Biden and his family another likely embarrassing and painful criminal trial of the president's son.,"right"
Hunter Biden's stunning decision to plead guilty to misdemeanor and felony charges without the benefits of a deal with prosecutors came hours after jury selection was supposed to begin in the case accusing him of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes.,"right"
The tax trial was expected to showcase more potentially lurid evidence as well as details about Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, which Republicans have seized on to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt.,"right"
Although President Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential election muted the potential political implications of the tax case, the trial was expected to carry a heavy emotional toll for the president in the final months of his five-decade political career.,"right"
"Enough is enough," defense attorney Abbe Lowell told the judge before Hunter Biden entered his plea.,"right"
"Mr. Biden is prepared, because of the public and private interest, to proceed today and finish this.","right"
Hunter Biden quickly responded "guilty" as the judge read out each of the nine counts.,"right"
Prosecutors were caught off guard when Hunter Biden's lawyer told the judge Thursday morning that Hunter wanted to enter what's known as an Alford plea, under which a defendant maintains their innocence but acknowledges prosecutors have enough evidence to secure a conviction.,"right"
Prosecutors said they objected to such a plea, telling the judge that Hunter Biden "is not entitled to plead guilty on special terms that apply only to him.","right"
"Hunter Biden is not innocent.,"right"
Hunter Biden is guilty," prosecutor Leo Wise said.,"right"
Hunter Biden walked into the courtroom holding hands with his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, and flanked by Secret Service agents.,"right"
Hunter Biden had agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses last year in a deal with the Justice Department that would allow him to avoid prosecution in the gun case if he stayed out of trouble.,"right"
Scarsi, who was appointed to the bench by former President Donald Trump, also placed some restrictions on what jurors would be allowed to hear about the traumatic events that Hunter Biden's family, friends and attorneys say led to his drug addiction.,"right"
The judge barred attorneys from connecting his substance abuse struggles to the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer or the car accident that killed his mother and sister when he was a toddler.,"right"
The indictment alleged that Hunter Biden lived lavishly while flouting the tax law, spending his cash on things like strippers and luxury hotels — "in short, everything but his taxes.","right"
Hunter Biden's attorneys had asked Scarsi to also limit prosecutors from highlighting details of his expenses that they say amount to a "character assassination," including payments made to strippers or pornographic websites.,"right"
Prosecutors had said they want to introduce evidence about Hunter Biden's overseas dealings, which have been at the center of Republican investigations into the Biden family often seeking — without evidence— to tie the president to an alleged influence peddling scheme.,"right"
The special counsel's team had planned to have a business associate of Hunter Biden's testify about their work for a Romanian businessman, who prosecutors say sought to "influence U.S. government policy" while Joe Biden was vice president.,"right"
Sentencing in Hunter Biden's Delaware conviction is set for Nov.,"right"
President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump traded barbs and a variety of false and misleading information as they faced off in their first debate of the 2024 election.,"right"
Biden, who tends to lean more on exaggerations and embellishments rather than outright lies, misrepresented the cost of insulin and overstated what Trump said about using disinfectant to address COVID.,"right"
TRUMP, on Biden: “He wants to raise your taxes by four times.”,"right"
Biden actually wants to prevent tax increases on anyone making less than $400,000, which is the vast majority of taxpayers.,"right"
More importantly, Biden’s budget proposal does not increase taxes as much as Trump claims, though the increases are focused on corporations and the wealthy.,"right"
6, 2021, the day a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol in an effort to stop the certification of Biden’s victory: “On January 6th we had the lowest taxes ever.,"right"
Out-of-pocket insulin costs for older Americans on Medicare were capped at $35 in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that President Joe Biden signed into law.,"right"
But Biden regularly overstates that many people used to pay up to $400 monthly.,"right"
THE FACTS: Trump is wrong to say that Biden pays any sort of fee “every time” to secure the release of hostages and wrongfully detained Americans.,"right"
Just like in the Trump administration, the deals during the Biden administration that have brought home hostages and detainees involved prisoner swaps — not money transfers.,"right"
It was Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the first lady, who used the term “super predator” to advocate for the 1994 crime bill that Biden co-authored more than thirty years ago.,"right"
Biden did warn of “predators” in a floor speech in support of his bill.,"right"
TRUMP, referring to Biden: “He’s the one that killed people with a bad border and flooding hundreds of thousands of people dying and also killing our citizens when they come in.”,"right"
In fact, growth has been stronger so far under Biden than under Trump.,"right"
The participation rate has also been higher under Biden than Trump.,"right"
“THE FACTS: At least 16 service members have been killed in hostile action since Biden took office in January 2021.,"right"
WASHINGTON - Looking to undermine rival Joe Biden two weeks before the election, President Donald Trump's campaign has seized on a tabloid story offering bizarre twists to a familiar line of attack: Biden's relationship with Ukraine.,"right"
The origins of the story also trace back to Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who has repeatedly pushed unfounded claims about Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.,"right"
Even if the emails in the Post are legitimate, they don't validate Trump and Giuliani's claims that Biden's actions were influenced by his son's business dealings in Ukraine.,"right"
Hunter Biden joined the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma in 2014, around the time his father, then U.S. vice president, was helping conduct the Obama administration's foreign policy with Ukraine.,"right"
Trump and his supporters, meanwhile, have advanced a widely discredited theory that Biden pushed for the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor to protect his son and Burisma from investigation.,"right"
Biden did indeed press for the prosecutor's firing, but that's because he was reflecting the official position of not only the Obama administration but many Western countries and because the prosecutor was perceived as soft on corruption.,"right"
The main email highlighted by the Post is an April 2015 message that it said was sent to Hunter Biden by Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to Burisma's board.,"right"
In it, he thanks the younger Biden "for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent (sic) some time together.,"right"
The wording makes it unclear if he actually met Joe Biden.,"right"
The Biden campaign said in a statement that it had reviewed Biden's schedules from the time and that no meeting as described by the newspaper took place.,"right"
The Post says it received a copy of a hard drive containing the messages from Giuliani, who has pushed the idea that Ukraine was trying to interfere with the 2016 election and that the younger Biden may have enriched himself by selling his access to his father.,"right"
It says the customer, whom the owner could not definitively identify as Hunter Biden, never paid for the service or retrieved it, and says the owner made a copy of the hard drive that he provided to Giuliani's lawyer.,"right"
Hunter Biden himself has not spoken publicly in the last week, including to confirm whether or not the laptop is his.,"right"
The Biden campaign has also not addressed that question, though a lawyer for Hunter Biden, George Mesires, said in a statement last week that "we have no idea where this came from, and certainly cannot credit anything that Rudy Giuliani provided to the NY Post.","right"
Some former national security officials and other experts said the episode raised multiple red flags of a possible foreign disinformation effort, especially given the involvement of Giuliani and his active role in promoting an anti-Biden narrative on Ukraine.,"right"
The suggestion that Joe Biden might have met with a Burisma representative is consequential, because he has repeatedly insisted that he never discussed his son's business with him.,"right"
But the emails provide no details on whether Pozharskyi and Biden actually met and, if so, what they discussed.,"right"
If Biden did meet with Pozharskyi, he was not the only U.S. official who may have done so.,"right"
With two weeks until Election Day and polls showing him trailing Biden, Trump appears to be returning to the subject of his opponent's family to energize his base.,"right"
Trump's called for a full accounting of Biden's conversations with Hunter and with Pozharskyi.,"right"
Trump said in an interview with Newsmax that the Post had caught Biden "cold" with "serious" allegations.,"right"
Biden's campaign, meanwhile, pointed to the recent Republican-led Senate investigation that found no evidence of wrongdoing on Biden's part with regard to Ukraine.,"right"
President Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential contest is becoming, in the sense of complimentary to him, reflecting well on him.,"right"
True to form, former President Donald Trump reacted with a series of crude personal insults, including the statement that Biden never should have run.,"right"
Joe Biden along with our other presidents took a formal oath to serve, and has a professional if not legal obligation to continue the work of the office until the completion of his term.,"right"
This is a precedent for Biden’s decision, contrary to some comments that his action is “unprecedented.” Johnson made the announcement on March 31, 1968, at the conclusion of a speech about de-escalation in the Vietnam War.,"right"
J.B. Pritzker is once again publicly pressuring President Joe Biden to play a larger role in coordinating relocation efforts.,"right"
Greg Abbott, Pritzker blamed political leaders who "have shipped people to our state like cargo in a dehumanizing attempt to score political points." But he also faulted the Biden administration for its lack of support for Illinois, which has already dedicated $330 million to addressing the influx of 15,000 migrants and counting.,"right"
The governor has been a vocal Biden ally, including in his monthslong effort to bring the Democratic National Convention to Chicago next summer.,"right"
In his carefully worded letter, the governor thanked Biden for steps his administration had taken to assist Illinois' response to the migrant crisis, like providing "modest" funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency.,"right"
Pritzker urged the Biden administration to "take a much more active role in managing the transport and destination of the transport of asylum-seekers.","right"
At the end of August, when the number of asylum-seekers who'd arrived in Chicago numbered approximately 13,000, Pritzker and other political and business leaders urged the Biden administration to allow Illinois to sponsor work permits for migrants.,"right"
But Pritzker argued that TPS-eligible migrants will still have to wait months for their work authorization paperwork to clear, and he urged further action from Biden to "cut the red tape.","right"
And for non-Venezuelan migrants, the governor asked Biden to waive the "high cost" fee to apply for TPS.,"right"
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden pardoned his son, Hunter, on Sunday night, sparing the younger Biden a possible prison sentence for federal felony gun and tax convictions and reversing his past promises not to use the extraordinary powers of the presidency for the benefit of his family members.,"right"
The move comes weeks before Hunter Biden was set to receive his punishment after his trial conviction in the gun case and guilty plea on tax charges, and less than two months before President-elect Donald Trump is set to return to the White House.,"right"
It caps a long-running legal saga for the younger Biden, who publicly disclosed he was under federal investigation in December 2020 — a month after his father’s 2020 victory — and casts a pall over the elder Biden's legacy.,"right"
Biden, who time and again pledged to Americans that he would restore norms and respect for the rule of law after Trump's first term in office, ultimately used his position to help his son, breaking his public pledge to Americans that he would do no such thing.,"right"
In June, Biden categorically ruled out a pardon or commutation for his son, telling reporters as his son faced trial in the Delware gun case, “I abide by the jury decision.,"right"
8, days after Trump's victory, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre ruled out a pardon or clemency for the younger Biden, saying, “We’ve been asked that question multiple times.,"right"
In a statement released Sunday evening, Biden said, “Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter,” alleging that the prosecution of his son was politically motivated and a “miscarriage of justice.”,"right"
“The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election,” Biden said.,"right"
“I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision,” Biden added, claiming he made the decision this weekend.,"right"
Hunter Biden was convicted in June in Delaware federal court of three felonies for purchasing a gun in 2018 when, prosecutors said, he lied on a federal form by claiming he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs.,"right"
Hunter Biden said he was pleading guilty in that case to spare his family more pain and embarrassment after the gun trial aired salacious details about his struggles with a crack cocaine addiction.,"right"
Biden is hardly the first president to deploy his pardon powers to benefit those close to him.,"right"
Hunter Biden said in an emailed statement that he will never take for granted the relief granted to him and vowed to devote the life he has rebuilt “to helping those who are still sick and suffering.”,"right"
“I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction – mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport,” the younger Biden said.,"right"
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says staffers for U.S. Vice President Joe Biden are arriving in Israel ahead of a possible Biden visit.,"right"
At his weekly Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu cited reports Biden was considering visiting Israel soon.,"right"
He said Biden's staff is landing in Israel Sunday, but there were no dates yet for a visit.,"right"
Last month, Biden met Netanyahu in Davos, Switzerland shortly after the U.S. lifted sanctions on Iran as part of a nuclear deal.,"right"
Biden's last visit to Israel sparked a diplomatic spat with Washington in 2010, when Israel announced settlement construction plans during Biden's visit.,"right"
But in the days since President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance, the presumptive Republican nominee has kept a low profile, leaving the focus on the drama engulfing the Democratic Party as he and his campaign revel in a series of legal and political victories heading into the Republican National Convention this month.,"right"
Trump's run began last week during the first debate, when Biden delivered a performance so dismal that he has spent the days since fending off calls from alarmed Democrats to step aside to save the party from losses up and down the ballot.,"right"
On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution, limiting the indictment against Trump for his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden.,"right"
The flood of good news — along with a major fundraising haul that has eliminated what had been Biden’s substantial cash advantage — has given Trump and his team cause for celebration as they head into the convention this month.,"right"
And it has frustrated Biden supporters who would prefer to focus on Trump's sweeping second-term agenda and comments he made during the debate minimizing the Capitol riot and suggesting he might not accept the results of this election, either.,"right"
But Trump’s team, recognizing that Biden’s campaign faces intense pressure, is perfectly happy to keep the focus on the incumbent, according to people familiar with the strategy who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the campaign’s thinking.,"right"
Brendan Buck, a Republican strategist who's not a Trump supporter, credited the ex-president for what he called an “uncharacteristically disciplined” response to the debate and for “letting Biden sort of twist in the wind.”,"right"
Given the current situation, Lewandowski said, there's “no reason to announce anything and take the media attention away from Joe Biden.”,"right"
“All of these things are indications that the campaign is looking to keep their foot on the gas and keep the pressure on the Biden campaign,” he said.,"right"
In the meantime, aides have been exulting in the Biden campaign's troubles.,"right"
Steven Cheung, Trump’s chief spokesperson, dialed into a Biden campaign media call held Monday to respond to the Supreme Court’s ruling and mocked the campaign on social media for letting him join.,"right"
Biden and his allies, meanwhile, have tried to return the focus to Trump.,"right"
And Biden and his allies have warned about the implications of the Supreme Court ruling declaring Trump immune from prosecution for key moments listed in the Jan.,"right"
Liz Cheney, a Republican critic, was “guilty of treason” and asked supporters to share it if they wanted “televised military tribunals.” Another post featured photos of Biden and other senior Democratic and Republican officials and suggested they should be jailed.,"right"
“Trump now has the cover he needs to jail and assassinate his opponents, direct the military to overturn a free and fair election, and take cash in bribes for pardons — with full immunity,” Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa charged in a statement.,"right"
His campaign announced Tuesday that it had outraised Biden in the year’s second quarter, with a reported haul of $331 million.,"right"
In a sign of how Trump's opponents feel about the state of the race, Buck, the Republican strategist, warned the former president could be in trouble if the debate fallout does somehow push Biden out of the race, even though that currently seems unlikely.,"right"
Trump could then face a fresher face who is potentially more energetic and a better campaigner than Biden.,"right"
“This lucky week could turn unlucky,” Buck said, “if it means Biden drops out.”,"right"
Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, introduced him to a senior official from a Ukrainian energy firm that became the focus of controversy over the dismissal of a prosecutor who was investigating the company, the New York Post reported Wednesday, citing an email it said came from Hunter Biden.,"right"
Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the board at Burisma, thanked Hunter Biden in an April 2015 email for inviting him to Washington and "giving an opportunity to meet your father," about a year after then vice-president's son had joined the company, according to the Post.,"right"
A May 2014 email also showed Pozharskyi sought advice from Hunter Biden on ways "you could use your influence" on Burisma's behalf, the paper reported.,"right"
The Post claims the communication contradicts an assertion by Joe Biden that he hasn't spoken to his son about his business dealings.,"right"
But the email doesn't detail the extent of the meeting or whether Biden spoke to his son about it.,"right"
The Biden campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.,"right"
President Donald Trump has charged that Joe Biden's actions in Ukraine, in which he pushed for the dismissal of the country's prosecutor general, were to benefit his son, Hunter.,"right"
In pushing for the firing of Viktor Shokin, Biden was acting in concert with official U.S. foreign policy and other allied nations who viewed Shokin as corrupt.,"right"
While Shokin had been investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that Hunter Biden was on the board of, the investigation had long been dormant by the time the vice president was pushing for Shokin's ouster in early 2016, a former Ukrainian official told Bloomberg News in May 2019.,"right"
Two Senate Republican committee chairman last month tried to revive allegations around Hunter Biden's dealings in Ukraine but their report broke little new ground in finding that his role on the board of Burisma put State Department officials in an "awkward" position.,"right"
Joe Biden has made it clear that despite his dismal, embarrassing, very faltering debate performance last month, he's running.,"right"
Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, signaled that Biden should bow out, but by Tuesday morning, Nadler pledged fealty to the one Democrat most likely to lose to Donald Trump.,"right"
Few Democrats have the stomach to risk being the party's scapegoats if Biden loses.,"right"
For the record, I believe it when the administration denies Biden has shown signs of Parkinson's.,"right"
I think Biden has cognitive problems.,"right"
Now that House Democrats know they can't push Biden off the stage, they can only play along.,"right"
“The president had a bad debate,” Carter added, but he likes the Biden record and doesn't believe in judging a man by one bad night.,"right"
Once NATO decamps, expect the White House to go into the same cover-up mode we saw Monday when Biden called into MSNBC's “Morning Joe” show.,"right"
There was no video of Biden — so you couldn't tell if he was slack-jawed, staring aimlessly, or reading certain staff-supplied quotes.,"right"
Until this month, the White House was able to squelch or somewhat discredit reporting on Biden's cognitive decline.,"right"
When The Wall Street Journal ran a piece in June under the headline, “Behind Closed Doors, Biden Shows Signs of Slipping,” Biden loyalists quickly pounced on the piece.,"right"
MSNBC's Joe Scarborough was among the faithful who scoffed at the notion that Biden was not sharp as a tack.,"right"
During Tuesday's briefing, KJP returned to the claim that Biden just had a bad night.,"right"
President Joe Biden made clear even before a verdict was returned that he would accept the verdict of the jury and would not use his pardon power for personal reasons, that he would provide the emotional support of a loving father but not the political power of a presidential pardon for his son.,"right"
He denounced the system as “rigged” against him, impugned the jury, blamed the judge as biased, and claimed it was all the fault of the Biden administration and its politicization of the Justice Department — even though the prosecution had nothing to do with the Justice Department and was entirely the work of the Manhattan District!,"right"
Biden, by contrast, in the face of a verdict convicting his only living son for wrongs he committed while suffering from the depths of addiction, issued a statement expressing both his love and loyalty to his son and his respect for the rule of law:,"right"
Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee pointed out, I have “not heard a single Democrat anywhere in the country cry 'fraud,' cry 'fixed,' cry 'rigged,' cry 'kangaroo court'” in response to Hunter Biden's federal conviction, as Republicans did after Trump's conviction, along with spreading the conspiracy theory that Biden was somehow responsible for the conviction.,"right"
But the Biden family surrounded Hunter throughout the trial.,"right"
But Hunter Biden only possessed the gun for 11 days and never used it.,"right"
For that, the former president — unlike Hunter Biden, whose crimes were victimless — deserves serious punishment.,"right"
On Friday, President Joe Biden will designate a national monument to commemorate the violent event, the White House confirmed to The Washington Post on Wednesday.,"right"
Biden, aiming to bolster his record on racial justice as he prepares to leave office in January, will sign the designation proclamation during an event at the White House with civil rights leaders and Illinois lawmakers.,"right"
Biden will bypass the gridlock by using his executive authority under the Antiquities Act, a 1906 law that authorizes the president to protect lands and waters for the benefit of all Americans.,"right"
Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers.,"right"
The growing anxiety among some residents is not lost on the Biden administration, which has faced criticism from Trump for not dealing with the matter more aggressively.,"right"
“Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”,"right"
Former Vice President Joe Biden hit three private fundraisers in Chicago on Thursday, prompting some criticism from presidential rival Bernie Sanders over a statement made by one of his hosts - billionaire casino and real estate mogul Neil Bluhm - and highlighting what many see as a major divide in the Democratic Party.,"right"
At the first fundraiser, Biden stopped by a luncheon at Bluhm's sprawling downtown residence near the Mag Mile.,"right"
Biden was introduced by Bluhm, who told his high-profile guests that both presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Sanders "don't represent the Democratic Party" that Bluhm supports.,"right"
Bluhm said Biden "has the best chance of defeating Trump.","right"
He claimed there was no inflation during his first term, when in fact inflation was over 4% when Biden took office.,"right"
Biden’s decision to pardon his son Hunter, after repeatedly promising he would not, has come under fire from not only conservatives but Democrats as well.,"right"
Now, whispers of Biden’s cynical contemplation of ‘preemptive pardons’ circulating in D.C. are proof that Democratic accusations of Trump lies and deceit are really a confession.,"right"
(AP) - Joe Biden bowed out as keynote speaker but Illinois Democrats matched the verbal salvos from Republican opponents at their annual state fair rally on Thursday that marked the informal start of the fall campaign.,"right"
Biden, the former vice president, did not attend the Democratic County Chairs' Association brunch because of illness.,"right"
WASHINGTON -- Leave it to Vice President Joe Biden to add a little, ahem, flair to the signing of a health care bill affecting millions of people.,"right"
"This is a big f------ deal," Biden told President Barack Obama after introducing him at Tuesday's ceremony at the White House.,"right"
Biden appeared to be offering that perspective to Obama privately, but his remark was captured on audio and video.,"right"
Biden has a reputation of verbal slips, and he knows it.,"right"
— President Joe Biden said Saturday that “everybody must condemn” the suspected assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, adding that he hoped to speak with his 2024 presidential rival soon.,"right"
Addressing the nation about two hours after the shooting, Biden said he was relieved that Trump is reportedly “doing well.” He said he had been unable to reach Trump before his remarks and pledged to update the public later Saturday on whether they speak as well as additional details about the investigation.,"right"
“We cannot allow this to be happening,” Biden said.,"right"
Biden, speaking without a teleprompter, said he was waiting for additional information before formally calling the attack an attempted assassination on the former president.,"right"
Biden turned toward reporters with a serious look on his face but replied simply, “no,” before stepping into his motorcade.,"right"
Biden received an “initial briefing” from aides moments later then convened security officials for a more in-depth update from Kimberly Cheatle, the director of the United States Secret Service, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and White House homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall.,"right"
Many Republicans quickly blamed the violence on Biden and his allies, arguing that sustained attacks on Trump as a threat to democracy have created a toxic environment.,"right"
They pointed in particular to a comment Biden made to donors on July 8, saying “it’s time to put Trump in the bull's-eye.”,"right"
The Biden campaign said Saturday that it was pausing all messaging to supporters and working to pull down all of its television ads as quickly as possible in light of the shooting.,"right"
President Joe Biden was in Joliet Saturday repeating a campaign message that Republicans pose a threat to Social Security and want to reverse health care savings delivered by Democrats.,"right"
Biden's speech to a few hundred supporters at Jones Elementary School comes ahead of the final day of voting on Tuesday in a midterm election in which forecasters expect Republicans to make gains and possibly take control of both houses of Congress.,"right"

Biden appeared with U.S. Rep.,"right"
Biden's visit to Joliet, at a time when the president is traveling around the country to bolster Democrats chances in the midterm election, suggests Underwood is in a close contest.,"right"
Biden came into Kendall County for his appearance at Jones Elementary School.,"right"
Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth before Biden.,"right"
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race for the White House on Sunday, ending his bid for reelection after a disastrous debate with Donald Trump that raised doubts about the incumbent's fitness for office.,"right"
Biden's July decision comes after more than 14 million Democrats cast votes supporting him through the primary process.,"right"
Harris, in a statement, praised Biden’s “selfless and patriotic act” and said she intends to “earn and win” her party’s nomination.,"right"
Biden's decision to bow out came after escalating pressure from his Democratic allies to step aside following the June 27 debate, in which the 81-year-old president trailed off, often gave nonsensical answers and failed to call out the former president’s many falsehoods.,"right"
And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term," Biden wrote in a letter posted Sunday to his X account.,"right"
Nearly 30 minutes after he delivered the news that he was folding his campaign, Biden threw his support behind Harris.,"right"
There were early signs that the party was moving to coalesce around Harris, who scored the endorsements of the Congressional Black Caucus and former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton even before she had commented on Biden's decision to quit the race.,"right"
But Obama, who had privately shared doubts about Biden’s reelection chances, stopped short of endorsing Harris even as he praised Biden for his decision to leave the race.,"right"
Biden's decision came as he has been isolating at his Delaware beach house after being diagnosed with COVID-19 last week, huddling with a shrinking circle of close confidants and family members about his political future.,"right"
Biden said he would address the nation later this week to provide “detail” about his decision.,"right"
Harris found out about Biden's plans on Sunday morning and senior campaign and White House staff were notified just minutes before the letter went out, according to people familiar with the matter who commented on the private discussions on condition of anonymity.,"right"
Biden had been reflecting on his future for the past couple days and the decision was closely held.,"right"
And for his part, Trump must shift his focus to a new opponent after years of training his attention on Biden.,"right"
The decision marks a swift and stunning end to Biden’s 52 years in electoral politics, as donors, lawmakers and even aides expressed to him their doubts that he could convince voters that he could plausibly handle the job for another four years.,"right"
Biden won the vast majority of delegates and every nominating contest but one, which would have made his nomination a formality.,"right"
Harris, 59, appeared to be the natural successor, in large part because she is the only candidate who can directly tap into the Biden campaign’s war chest, according to federal campaign finance rules.,"right"
Biden’s campaign formally changed its name to Harris for President, reflecting that she is inheriting his political operation — a sign of the leg up she has in the race for the Democratic nomination.,"right"
19-22 in Chicago, but the party had announced it would hold a virtual roll call to formally nominate Biden before in-person proceedings begin.,"right"
The Tennessee Democratic Party posted on X that its delegation voted during a meeting Sunday to back Harris after Biden’s departure from the campaign.,"right"
Trump reacted to the news in a post on his Truth Social site, in which he said Biden “was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve.”,"right"
While Trump and his team had made their preference for facing Biden clear, his campaign had nonetheless ramped up its attacks on Harris as pressure on Biden to step down intensified.,"right"
Democratic officials, including many who were behind the effort to push Biden from the race, quickly released statements praising Biden's decision.,"right"
House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York praised Biden as “one of the most accomplished and consequential leaders in American history.”,"right"
Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said Biden should immediately resign if he is not fit enough to run for office.,"right"
In addition to his planned address to the country, Biden still intends to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House this week, according to a person familiar with the president’s schedule who was not authorized to comment publicly.,"right"
The exact timing of the meeting is still not set in stone as Biden continues to recover from COVID.,"right"
In 2020, Biden pitched himself as a transitional figure who wanted to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders.,"right"
Biden was once asked whether any other Democrats could beat Trump.,"right"
“Probably 50 of them,” Biden replied.,"right"
Biden is already the country’s oldest president and had insisted repeatedly that he was up for the challenge of another campaign and another term, telling voters all they had to was “watch me.”,"right"
Concerns over Biden’s age have dogged him since he announced he was running for reelection, though Trump is just three years younger at 78.,"right"
Biden often remarked that he was not as young as he used to be, doesn’t walk as easily or speak as smoothly, but that he had wisdom and decades of experience, which were worth a whole lot.,"right"
“I give you my word as a Biden.,"right"
Biden’s motivation for running was deeply intertwined with Trump.,"right"
Biden's wife, first lady Jill Biden, responded to the president's announcement by reposting Biden's letter announcing his decision and adding red heart emojis.,"right"
Granddaughter Naomi Biden Neal said on social media, “I’m nothing but proud of my Pop.” She said he has served the country “with every bit of his soul and with unmatched distinction” and “our world is better today in so many ways thanks to him.”,"right"
Some social media users compared Trump’s video of the visit to a 2010 post by President Joe Biden.,"right"
Joe Biden literally did a campaign ad at the graves in Arlington in 2020.,"right"
It included a photo from a May 25, 2020 Memorial Day campaign ad from Biden’s official account.,"right"
The photo of Biden visiting the graves in Section 60 was taken when he was vice president.,"right"
At the time, Biden wasn’t running for office.,"right"
Biden’s campaign ad also included a disclaimer at the beginning of the video which stated, “The use of U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) visual information does not imply or constitute endorsement of the U.S. military, any military personnel or the Department of Defense.”,"right"
Trump’s video included a narration that criticized Biden’s handling of the U.S. withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.,"right"
Climate Power, a group that advocates for clean energy, in a June 20 report said, more than 300,000 jobs were “announced or [have] moved forward.” A U.S. Department of Energy report said 256,000 clean energy jobs were added in 2023 and 2024, but there are no estimates of how many of those jobs were the result of Biden administration policies.,"right"
Phil Murphy has asked the Biden administration to put more resources into an investigation of mysterious drone sightings that have been reported in New Jersey and nearby states.,"right"
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Joe Biden lauded the sacrifice of generations of U.S. troops who "dared all and gave all" fighting for their country and called on Americans to ensure that their "sacrifice was not in vain" as he marked Memorial Day with the traditional wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery.,"right"

Monday's federal holiday honoring America's fallen service members came a day after Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy reached final agreement on a deal that would raise America's debt limit and that now awaits approval by Congress.,"right"
Biden has taken pride that his Democratic administration has overseen a time of relative peace for the U.S. military after two decades of war in Afghanistan and Iraq.,"right"
It's been nearly 21 months since Biden ended the United States' longest war in Afghanistan, making good on a campaign promise to end a 20-year-old "forever war" that cost the lives of more than 2,400 U.S. service members.,"right"
The war in Afghanistan, however, ended in chaotic and deadly fashion on Biden's watch in August 2021 with critics blasting the administration's handling of the evacuation of some 120,000 American citizens, Afghans and others as poorly planned and badly executed.,"right"
The Biden administration last month released a review of the last days of the war, largely blaming his Republican predecessor, President Donald Trump, and asserting that Biden was "severely constrained" by Trump's decisions.,"right"
While making clear that he has no desire for U.S. troops to enter the conflict, Biden has maintained that he sees the Russian effort to grab territory as an affront to international norms and has vowed to help Kyiv win, sending artillery, tanks and drones and recently agreeing to allow allies to train Ukrainian military on American F-16 jets.,"right"
Biden connected the sacrifices of some 400,000 Americans buried at Arlington to the work of U.S. troops deployed around the world today, saying the impact of the fallen men and women "goes far beyond those silent stones" of the solemn burial ground.,"right"
"We see the strength of our NATO alliance built from the bonds that were forged in the fires of two World Wars," Biden said.,"right"
During the Arlington ceremony, Biden also spoke of the need to care for U.S. service members on and off the battlefield.,"right"
"We have only one truly sacred obligation: to prepare those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home and when they don't," Biden said.,"right"
Before Monday's ceremony at the Arlington, Virginia, cemetery, the Bidens hosted a breakfast at the White House for members of veterans organizations, military service and military family organizations, surviving families of fallen U.S. troops, senior Department of Defense officials and other administration officials.,"right"

Biden also won the Democratic primaries in Utah, Vermont and Iowa.,"right"
Not enough states will have voted until later this month for Trump or Biden to formally become their parties’ presumptive nominees.,"right"

His aides insist that skeptical voters will come around once it is clear that either Trump or Biden will be elected again in November.,"right"
Trump is now the same age Biden was during the 2020 campaign, and he has exacerbated questions about his own fitness with recent flubs, such as mistakenly suggesting he was running against Barack Obama, who left the White House in 2017.,"right"

Biden's move also follows the presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who has said he would bring about a swift end to the war and raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue the United States' vital military support for Ukraine.,"right"
Zelenskyy and many of his Western supporters have been pressing Biden for months to allow Ukraine to strike military targets deeper inside Russia with Western-supplied missiles, saying the U.S. ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids.,"right"

Biden must show skeptics during his whirlwind day with world leaders at NATO, and the evening press conference that he is up for another four years.,"right"
Hillary Scholten, whose district is in the battleground state of Michigan, became the latest Democrat in Congress to call on Biden to step out of the race, telling The Detroit News that people can’t “unsee” Biden’s terrible debate performance.,"right"
The first-term Democrat praised Biden’s legacy but said in a statement that “it’s time to pass the torch.”,"right"
But House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi opened the door this week to a continued conversation about Biden's political future when she publicly said “it’s up to the president” to decide what to do — even though Biden had already emphatically told Congress he was staying in the race.,"right"
Jeffries, who supports Biden and the Democratic ticket, said House and Senate Democrats remain unified on the agenda ahead that includes growing the middle class, fighting for reproductive rights and pushing back against Trump and the far-right Project 2025 agenda.,"right"
While Biden has expressed confidence in his chances, his campaign on Thursday acknowledged he is behind, and a growing number of the president’s aides in the White House and the campaign privately harbor doubts that the president can turn things around.,"right"
But they’re taking their cues from Biden, expressing that he is in 100% unless and until he isn’t, and there appears to be no organized internal effort to persuade the president to step aside.,"right"
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer invited Biden’s team to meet with senators privately at the lunch hour to discuss concerns and the path forward, but some senators groused they would prefer to hear from the president himself.,"right"
Though senior campaign aides write in the memo that Biden could clinch 270 electoral votes in a number of ways, it also says those three states are critical and that is why Biden has prioritized the areas in his recent travels.,"right"
Campaign leaders say they want to continue touting Biden’s achievements in office, drawing a contrast with Trump and his policies, and redoubling their grassroots efforts to engage voters — which were their goals anyway before the disastrous June 27 debate that left in question Biden’s cognitive capabilities and fitness to serve.,"right"
Their internal research suggests that voters will make their decisions based on policies and issues, rather than Biden's age, O'Malley Dillon and Rodriguez contend.,"right"
Polls conducted after the debate have largely agreed that Democrats nationwide have doubts about Biden’s ability to lead the ticket in November.,"right"
More than half of Democrats, 56%, in a recent Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll said that given Biden’s debate performance, he should step aside and let someone else run.,"right"
But the Biden campaign points to this same poll to argue that despite the “increased anxiety” after the debate, his performance was not leading to a “drastic shift in vote share.”,"right"
And around 6 in 10 voters, including about one-quarter of Democrats, said that reelecting Biden as president this November would be a risky choice for the country rather than a safe one, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll.,"right"
WASHINGTON — A rapidly growing chorus of Democratic lawmakers called Friday for President Joe Biden to drop his reelection bid, even as the president insisted he’s ready to return to the campaign trail next week to counter what he called a “dark vision” laid out by Republican Donald Trump.,"right"
As more Democratic members of Congress urged him to drop out — bringing the total since his disastrous debate against Trump to nearly three dozen — Biden remained isolated at his beach house in Delaware after being diagnosed with COVID-19.,"right"
Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is in a tough race for reelection, called for Biden to step aside.,"right"
Biden said Trump's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention showcased a “dark vision for the future." The president, seeking to move the political conversation away from his fate and onto his rival's agenda, said Friday he was planning to return to the campaign trail next week and insisted he has a path to victory over Trump, despite the worries of some of his party's most eminent members.,"right"
“Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box,” Biden said.,"right"
She said voters concerned about Biden's fitness to lead aren't switching to vote for Trump.,"right"
“President Biden deserves the respect to have important family conversations with members of the caucus and colleagues in the House and Senate and Democratic leadership and not be battling leaks and press statements,” Sen.,"right"
Chris Coons of Delaware, Biden’s closest friend in Congress and his campaign co-chair, told The Associated Press.,"right"
And Democrats, racing time, are considering the extraordinary possibility of Biden stepping aside for a new presidential nominee before their own convention.,"right"
Among the democrats expressing worries to allies about Biden's chances were former President Barack Obama and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who has privately told Biden the party could lose the ability to seize control of the House if he doesn’t step aside.,"right"
Martin Heinrich called on Biden to exit the race, making him the third Senate Democrat to do so.,"right"
Jared Huffman, Mark Veasey, Chuy Garcia and Mark Pocan, representing a wide swath of the caucus, together called on Biden to step aside.,"right"
Sean Casten of Illinois wrote in an op-ed that with “a heavy heart and much personal reflection” he, too, was calling on Biden to “pass the torch to a new generation.”,"right"
Campaign officials said Biden was even more committed to staying in the race.,"right"
On Friday, Biden picked up a key endorsement from the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.,"right"
CHC BOLD PAC said the Biden administration has shown “unwavering commitment” to Latinos and “the stakes couldn’t be higher” in this election.,"right"
Biden has been told the campaign is having trouble raising money, and key Democrats see an opportunity as he is away from the campaign for a few days to encourage his exit.,"right"
Biden, 81, tested positive for COVID-19 while traveling in Las Vegas earlier this week and experienced “mild symptoms” including “general malaise” from the infection, the White House said.,"right"
One lawmaker said Biden’s own advisers are unable to reach a unanimous recommendation about what he should do.,"right"
More in Congress are considering joining the others who have called for Biden to drop out.,"right"
Peter Welch, the other Senate Democrat who has publicly said Biden should exit the race.,"right"
To be sure, many want Biden to stay in the race.,"right"
But among Democrats nationwide, nearly two-thirds say Biden should step aside and let his party nominate a different candidate, according to an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.,"right"
That sharply undercuts Biden's post-debate claim that “average Democrats” are still with him.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and his likely Republican challenger Donald Trump both head to the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas on Thursday in a sign of how central immigration has become to the 2024 election and how much both candidates want to use it to their advantage.,"right"
Biden, who wants to spotlight how Republicans tanked a bipartisan border security deal on Trump's orders, will go to the Rio Grande Valley city of Brownsville.,"right"
Trump, for his part, wants to continue his attacks on Biden and keep up his dialed-up rhetoric after saying migrants were poisoning the blood of Americans.,"right"
Among voters, worries about the nation’s broken immigration system are rising on both sides of the political divide, which could be especially problematic for Biden.,"right"
Trump and Republicans claim Biden is refusing to act, but absent law change from Congress, any major policies are likely to be challenged or held up in court.,"right"
Trump this week said Biden was copying him by heading to the border, although the White House insisted the president’s trip was quietly in the works before Trump's visit was announced.,"right"
Unlike Trump, Biden has made few trips to the border.,"right"
During bipartisan talks on an immigration deal that would have toughened access for migrants, Biden himself said he'd be willing to “shut down the border” right now, should the deal pass.,"right"
But Trump, who didn't want to give Biden a political win on one of his signature campaign issues, convinced Republicans to kill the deal.,"right"
Biden vowed to make sure everyone knew why.,"right"
“Every day, between now and November, the American people are gonna know that the only reason the border is not secure is Donald Trump and his MAGA Republican friends,” Biden said earlier this month, referring to the former president's Make America Great Again slogan.,"right"
The Biden administration sued, and the U.S. Supreme Court allowed federal agents to cut the razor wire encircling the park, but Abbott has since put more up in a defiant move that challenges federal authority.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden met Wednesday with the executive council of the AFL-CIO, America’s largest federation of trade unions, to shore up support from a critical constituency as he beats back continued calls to step aside in the 2024 campaign.,"right"
Hours later in the Oval Office, when a reporter asked him about an opinion piece written by George Clooney in which the actor implored Biden to leave the 2024 race, the president responded with “AFL-CIO!” paused, pumped his fists and added, “Go, go, go.”,"right"
His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders.,"right"
Biden spoke with a handheld mic and no teleprompter in sight.,"right"
Biden is close to many union leaders who were in room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend.,"right"
“I said I’m going to be the most pro-union president in American history,” Biden told the cheering crowd.,"right"
In announcing Biden, Shuler told the room he has supported jobs, manufacturing and created good union jobs in clean energy.,"right"
So far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration, despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate.,"right"
The AFL-CIO said Thursday that Biden's “fighting spirit” was on full display in the back and forth with union leaders.,"right"
Still, some statements of support are also worded diplomatically to suggest a degree of flexibility in case Biden chooses to drop out — saying they back the Biden-Harris administration and not just Biden personally.,"right"
The AFL-CIO said it unanimously voted on Thursday to “reaffirm” its backing of “President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the leadership of the most pro-union administration in our lifetimes.”,"right"
After Biden was interviewed by ABC News last week in the aftermath of his poor debate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, posted on X: “Biden is an incredible President and tonight we saw that he’s on top of the details.,"right"
He has my support and we’re ready to keep working for Biden-Harris to win in November.”,"right"
Some union leaders have been more targeted in their support for Biden and his continued candidacy.,"right"
United Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday's meeting that his union “proudly supports” Biden, saying that his “record of delivering for working people stands for itself.”,"right"
Kenneth Cooper, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was also firmly behind Biden, saying that his union members “couldn't ask for a stronger advocate.”,"right"
Wednesday's meeting was a test of whether Biden's emphasis on policy and loyalty to Democratic constituencies such as unions can overcome doubts about his candidacy.,"right"
Over the course of his term, Biden has tied his administration to the idea that labor unions built the middle class.,"right"
Biden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union's staff announced a strike and formed a picket line.,"right"
One person familiar with the labor movement's thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden's agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health.,"right"
Their pitch is that Biden's agenda has directly helped union workers while Trump's plans could leave them worse off.,"right"
In 2020, AP VoteCast found that 16% of voters came from union households and 56% of them supported Biden.,"right"
Biden and Trump essentially split nonunion households in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, meaning that the Democrat's edge with union households was likely a critical factor in his victory.,"right"
HELSINKI (AP) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has cautioned Europe against a new natural gas pipeline planned to stretch from Russia to Germany, saying it "looks like a fairly bad deal" for Europe because it further increases its energy dependency on Moscow.,"right"
Biden said Thursday that to lock Europe "into greater reliance on Russia at this moment ...,"right"
After talks with Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven in Stockholm, Biden told reporters that Russian gas "can and should be" part of the European market.,"right"
In an apparent reference to Russia, Biden said: "No country should be able to use energy as a weapon ...,"right"
Biden's trip to Sweden came at the end of a three-day tour when he also visited Latvia and Turkey.,"right"
Harris’ performance by nearly every measure seemed to be the opposite of President Joe Biden’s in June, with sharp, focused answers designed to hit her talking points while needling Trump, whereas Biden at times was muddled, halting and at times incoherent.,"right"
Harris used her body language and facial expressions to confront Trump and express that she found his answers ridiculous or amusing — or both — while Biden at times had a slack-jawed expression while Trump attacked him.,"right"
Trump in turn tried to link Harris to Biden, questioning why she hadn’t acted on her proposed ideas while serving as vice president.,"right"
Trump also focused his attacks on Harris over her assignment by Biden to deal with the root causes of illegal migration.,"right"
He repeatedly dismissed her and Biden as weak, and cited the praise of Hungary’s nationalist prime minister Viktor Orbán to show that he is a widely respected by leaders around the world, saying Orbán calls him the “most feared person.”,"right"
Trump again denied his loss to Biden four years ago, when his efforts to overturn the result inspired the Jan.,"right"
Harris said it was an example of why America's NATO allies were thankful he was no longer in office, as she and Biden have sent tens of billions of dollars to help Kyiv fend off Russia's invasion.,"right"
In rapid fashion after the June 27 debate between Trump and Biden, the incumbent bowed out of the race after his disastrous performance, Trump survived an assassination attempt and bothsides chose their running mates.,"right"
Trump at one point launched into an attack on Biden, questioning his mental acuity by making the claim that Biden “doesn’t even know he’s alive.”,"right"
“First of all, I think it’s important to remind the former president, you’re not running against Joe Biden.,"right"
Joe Biden has 42 more days to serve as president of the United States.,"right"
The real president for the next six weeks, Biden, was back home, resting up.,"right"
Biden seems less and less relevant to the conversation.,"right"
“Biden has effectively disappeared from the radar,” reports Politico.,"right"
But Biden is still president of the United States, and Trump is not.,"right"
If an emergency, a crisis, arises, Biden, even in his weakened condition, will have to deal with it.,"right"
Right now, it appears that much of the Biden administration is spending a significant amount of its time trying to “Trump-proof” Biden's policies — that is, to tie the incoming president's hands by making it difficult for him to change things.,"right"
For one thing, President Biden, at 82 years old, is no longer mentally and physically up to the job of being a full-time president.,"right"
In other words, Biden is ready to go, and Trump is ready to replace him.,"right"
— After weeks of uncertainty about who would be at the top of the Democratic Party’s ticket in November, many voters expressed relief over the news that President Joe Biden would drop his reelection bid and began to think about who might replace him in a dramatically altered election landscape.,"right"
Jerod Keene, a 40-year-old athletic trainer from swing-state Arizona, had planned to vote for Biden in November but was thankful for the president’s decision, calling it “inevitable.” Keene said he’s excited about the next candidate, hoping it will be Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Biden endorsed on Sunday.,"right"
The Democratic Party has been deeply divided since Biden’s poor debate performance on June 27, which left many questioning his ability to defeat Republican Donald Trump in November and secure another term.,"right"
Party leaders had increasingly called for Biden to step aside, but his reluctance to bow out left voters nationwide uncertain about who would face Trump in November.,"right"
Recent AP-NORC polling revealed that nearly two-thirds of Democrats felt Biden should withdraw from the presidential race, while a majority believe Harris would perform well in the top slot.,"right"
Keene’s relief that the saga surrounding Biden's decision was over was echoed by voters nationwide in interviews with The Associated Press.,"right"
In Pittsburgh, Fred Johnston said he has been terrified of another Trump presidency and had long worried that Biden couldn’t beat Trump again.,"right"
After seeing Biden’s wobbly debate performance, he was eager for Biden to drop out and hand off his candidacy to Harris.,"right"
In Las Vegas, Lucy Ouano, 68, said she was proud of both Biden’s decision to drop out of the race and his move to quickly endorse Harris.,"right"
Ouano, who emigrated in 1960 to the U.S. from Thailand as a young child with her parents, said she couldn’t have imagined this outcome just a few weeks ago when she attended a Harris rally in Las Vegas meant to quiet concerns about Biden’s reelection campaign.,"right"
At the time, she told the AP that while she planned on voting for Biden, she wanted Harris at the top of the ticket.,"right"
“She’s going to get the Asians drummed up, and she’s going to get the women drummed up,” Oaano said Sunday after learning about Biden’s decision.,"right"
Downard Jr., a 72-year-old resident of Portland, Oregon, viewed Biden's presidency favorably but said he was “very pleased” that Biden stepped aside.,"right"
The Democratic voter, who cast his ballot for Biden in 2020, said his opinion of Biden changed after what he called a “disastrous” debate.,"right"
Some voters, like Nebraska resident Lacey LeGrand, had planned to reluctantly vote for Biden simply because he wasn’t Trump.,"right"
“So I think by default I was going to end up supporting Biden.,"right"
LeGrand, a registered Democrat in Nebraska’s Omaha swing district, a potentially decisive electoral vote that Biden and Obama both won previously, believes Harris “has a shot” at defeating Trump, though she added, “I wouldn’t say it’s a great shot.”,"right"
Georgia voter Dorothy Redhead, 76, was “disappointed” that Biden dropped out of the race but said she is “just having to accept” Biden’s decision as one between the president and God.,"right"
Jarvia Haynes, a real estate agent in New Orleans, said she has “mixed feelings” about Biden’s decision to leave the race.,"right"
“I don’t think President Biden should have dropped out,” she said.,"right"
Barbara Orr, a psychotherapist in the Lancaster, Pennsylvania area, said she thought Biden was capable of running for president, beating Trump and serving as president.,"right"
Elizabeth Warren for president in 2020, said she would probably prefer Whitmer to replace Biden on the Democratic ticket.,"right"
Joe DeFrain was out kayaking when a text informed him that Biden had dropped out.,"right"
Biden visited They Say earlier this year, a moment that manager George Ledbetter said was “the best ever.”,"right"
I like Biden,” Ledbetter said.,"right"
LUANDA, Angola — Even in the waning days of his presidency and thousands of miles from home, U.S. President Joe Biden is finding ways to celebrate trains.,"right"
Biden used the third and final day of his visit to Angola on Wednesday to showcase the Lobito Corridor railway, where the U.S. and allies are investing heavily to refurbish 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) of train lines in Zambia, Congo and Angola.,"right"
“I’m probably the most pro-rail guy in America,” Biden, the first U.S. president to visit Angola, said during a speech Tuesday evening.,"right"
Biden has long had the nickname Amtrak Joe for the 36 years he spent commuting by U.S. train from his home in Delaware to Washington while in the Senate.,"right"
On Wednesday, Biden flew from the Angolan capital of Luanda to Lobito on Africa's Western coast to tour port facilities linked to the corridor with Angolan President João Lourenço, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and Tanzanian Vice President Philip Mpango.,"right"
Biden would also see an American General Electric locomotive used for cargo on the Lobito Atlantic Railway, the White House said, with the U.S. promoting the railway upgrade as a catalyst that it hopes will spark a new era of Western private sector investment in this part of Africa.,"right"
The Biden administration says the rail corridor will help business interests and counter China's growing influence in Africa.,"right"
In Lobito, Biden will announce $600 million in new U.S. investment for projects associated with the corridor, which has also drawn financing from the European Union, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, a Western-led private consortium and African banks.,"right"
Biden toured the Lobito port that will provide an outlet on the Atlantic Ocean and ideally a route to the West for Africa's minerals and other exports.,"right"
Biden announced that Congo had also committed a new $553 million direct loan to the railway to upgrade and operate more than 1,000 kilometers of line from Lobito to the Congo border.,"right"
The Lobito Corridor has become a model approach that the U.S. is looking to replicate in other parts of the world, said the official, who briefed reporters during Biden's Angola visit on condition of anonymity to offer project details that haven't yet been made public.,"right"
The Biden White House says that Republicans in Congress and elsewhere have supported past efforts to promote African business interests through targeted investments and that such initiatives have appealed to Trump and his key advisers in the past.,"right"
So, l just laugh when my 40- and 50-year old friends say Joe Biden is too old, too infirm, has dementia, needs to resign.,"right"
And I ask why Fox News or conservative social media never seems to mention that Donald Trump often mangles the words on his teleprompter, doesn't know the difference between Tennessee and Louisiana, Sioux Falls and Sioux City, thinks he beat Obama in 2016, says Biden's policies could lead to WWII, states America won the Revolutionary War because we had a better Air Force, hopes the stock market crashes, thinks Russia borders Hungary, and blames Nikki Haley for not stopping the riot on Jan.,"right"
On his worst day, Joe Biden is sharper, smarter, shows more leadership, understands international relations and works better with our allies, than Donald Trump ever did on his best day.,"right"
(AP) - President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, meet on the debate stage for the second and final time Thursday night in Tennessee.,"right"
National polls show him losing to Biden, and while some battleground state polls are tighter, even some of Trump's own allies are worrying aloud about the prospect of a serious defeat.,"right"
Trump needs to find a way to focus the debate - and the election more broadly - on Biden and his liabilities.,"right"
Trump and his allies in the conservative media have ramped up their focus on alleged maleficence by Biden's son Hunter in recent days.,"right"
Biden's team expects Trump to make those allegations a centerpiece of his debate strategy.,"right"
The president tried to make an issue in the first debate of Hunter Biden and his drug use, which the younger Biden has publicly acknowledged.,"right"
But Trump's attack may have backfired when Biden declared that he was proud of his son, who, like many Americans, had fought to overcome an addiction.,"right"
Trump believes he has more ammunition this time around, however, following the publication of a tabloid report offering a bizarre twist to familiar concerns about Hunter Biden's work overseas.,"right"
The report centers on data allegedly recovered from Hunter Biden's laptop, though the data has not been verified and, if it is legitimate, does not tie candidate Biden to any corruption.,"right"
Biden's team considers the issue a distraction from much more pressing concerns - namely, the pandemic - but Biden will certainly have to defend himself and his family again on Thursday night.,"right"
Biden's greatest foe Thursday night may be himself.,"right"
To that end, the 74-year-old Trump and his allies spent much of the year questioning Biden's mental and physical health.,"right"
While Biden quieted those questions with a solid performance in the first debate, they have not gone away.,"right"
Biden will certainly be prepared.,"right"
Still, Biden's history of self-imposed stumbles raises the distinct possibility that he could hurt his campaign, with or without Trump's help.,"right"
It doesn't help Biden that expectations will be higher after Trump's weak performance in the first debate.,"right"
This is in response to Susan Estrich's question "Exactly what has Joe Biden done that he shouldn't have done?" Here are just a few things:,"right"
BEIJING (AP) - Global stock markets turned higher Wednesday, extending days of volatility, as investors weighed the economic impact of the virus outbreak and Joe Biden's big gains in the Democratic primaries.,"right"
Sentiment seems to have been supported somewhat by Former U.S. Vice President Biden's revitalized presidential bid, with some investors seeing the moderate candidate as potentially more favorable to business than the more left-wing Bernie Sanders.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden's halting debate performance has led some in his own party to begin questioning whether he should be replaced on the ballot before November.,"right"
There is no evidence Biden is willing to end his campaign.,"right"
Delegates Biden won in the primaries are obligated to support him,"right"
Democratic rules mandate that the delegates Biden won remain obligated to support him at the party's upcoming national convention unless he tells them he’s leaving the race.,"right"
Biden indicated that he had no plans to do that, telling supporters in Atlanta shortly after he left the debate stage, “Let's keep going.” Biden campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt was even clearer, saying Friday: “Of course he's not dropping out.”,"right"
19 and change how things will work, but that isn't likely as long as Biden wants to continue seeking reelection.,"right"
VP Kamala Harris couldn't automatically replace Biden,"right"
The vice president is Biden's running mate, but that doesn't mean she can swap in for him at the top of the ticket by default.,"right"
Biden also can't decree that she replace him should he suddenly decide to leave the race.,"right"
The Democratic National Convention is being held in Chicago, but the party has announced that it will hold a virtual roll call to formally nominate Biden before in-person proceedings begin.,"right"
If Biden opts to abandon his reelection campaign, Harris would likely join other top Democratic candidates looking to replace him.,"right"
In addition to the vice president, others that had endorsed Biden in 2024 while harboring their own presidential aspirations for future cycles include California Gov.,"right"
Still others who Biden bested during the party’s 2020 presidential primary could also try again, including Sens.,"right"
If Biden were to abruptly leave the race, conservative groups have suggested they will file lawsuits around the country, potentially questioning the legality of the Democratic candidate's name on the ballot.,"right"
Images of the country reacting as Democrat Joe Biden defeats President Donald Trump to become the 46th president of the United States Saturday.,"right"
Jeff Aznavorian, the company president, thought he might enjoy some relief once Joe Biden entered the White House.,"right"
Instead, Biden largely preserved Trump’s tariffs — on steel, aluminum and a mass of goods from China.,"right"
“That’s just so different from a 2024 Biden administration.’’,"right"
Trump and Biden agree on essentially nothing, from taxes and climate change to immigration and regulation.,"right"
Which means that whether Biden or Trump wins the presidency, the United States seems poised to maintain a protectionist trade policy — a policy that experts say could feed inflation pressures.,"right"
Last week, in fact, Biden announced some new tariffs, on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells and other products, that he said would keep Beijing from flooding the United States with cheap imports.,"right"
For his part, Biden favors subsidizing such key industries as chipmaking and EV manufacturing to give them a competitive edge.,"right"
As last week's announcement showed, Biden isn't averse to new tariffs, either.,"right"
Dani Rodrik, a Harvard economist who was an early critic of the globalization of the 1990s and 2000s, views Biden trade policies more favorably than he does Trump’s approach.,"right"
By contrast, he said, “Biden’s approach is strategic and based on rebuilding U.S. manufacturing capacity and investing in the green transition, so fundamentally strengthening the U.S. economy rather than crass protectionism.”,"right"
After entering office, Biden retained many of Trump’s trade policies and made no effort to revive Obama’s old Pacific Rim trade pact.,"right"
Biden even turned up the heat on Beijing by restricting its access to advanced computer chips and the equipment to make them.,"right"
Biden’s China policies are “grounded in national security,’’ said Peterson's Lovely.,"right"
The Biden administration has rankled some U.S. allies by offering subsidies to encourage U.S. companies to manufacture goods in America.,"right"
Under Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, for instance, auto buyers can receive a $7,500 tax credit for purchasing an electric vehicle.,"right"
Biden’s initiatives — including incentives to produce green technology and computer chips in the United States — have spurred what looks like a surge of investment in manufacturing.,"right"
The presence of Torres-Navarro in the United States, free to go as he pleases, was a direct result of the border policies of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.,"right"
He is a one-man, walking illustration of the dangerous nature of the Biden-Harris border.,"right"
What the Torres-Navarro case shows is that U.S. authorities, under Biden and Harris, are not really checking anybody.,"right"
We've all seen the examples of horrendous crimes committed by people who crossed illegally into the U.S. during the Biden-Harris years.,"right"
“In three and a half years, the Biden-Harris administration has released more than 5.4 million illegal aliens into the United States, with an additional at least 1.9 million known 'gotaways' escaping into the country,” says a newly released report from the House Judiciary Committee.,"right"
We've also seen that Biden and Harris have changed the face of illegal immigration.,"right"
Among the 7.3 million illegal crossers Biden and Harris have released into the United States “are 375 illegal aliens on the U.S. government's terrorist watchlist,” according to the Judiciary Committee.,"right"
He is in the United States because of the way Biden and Harris chose to run the U.S.-Mexico border.,"right"
President Joe Biden on Wednesday laced into Donald Trump over a failed project in the previous administration that was supposed to bring thousands of new jobs into southeastern Wisconsin, and he trumpeted new economic investments under his watch that are coming to the same spot.,"right"
Biden was in Sturtevant, in Racine County, to promote a $3.3 billion Microsoft data center, which the Democratic president said will employ about 2,300 union construction workers to build it and then 2,000 permanent employees to staff it.,"right"
The location in will be the site of a center from Microsoft, whose president credited the Biden administration's economic policies for paving the way for the new investments.,"right"
For Biden, it offered another point of contrast between him and Trump, who had promised a $10 billion investment by the Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn that never came.,"right"
You kidding me?” Biden told the crowd of about 300 people, who clapped and cheered loudly as he spoke.,"right"
Noting that 100 homes were destroyed to make way for the project, which wasted hundreds of millions of dollars, Biden added a jab: “Foxconn turned out to be just that — a con.,"right"
Microsoft’s president Brad Smith said in an interview with The Associated Press that Microsoft had a “steadfast commitment to under-promising and over-delivering” and praised the Biden administration and the state’s Democratic governor, Tony Evers, for economic policies that set the stage for the developments announced Wednesday.,"right"
But Biden was eager to take the credit and use the opportunity to repeatedly take swings at Trump, arguing that his presumptive Republican challenger embraced the same type of “trickle-down economics” that Biden abhors and failed to revive domestic manufacturing during his four years in the White House.,"right"
“Folks, during the previous administration, my predecessor made promises, which he broke more than kept, left a lot of people behind in communities like Racine,” Biden said.,"right"
Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley said Biden's trip was an attempt to “save face in Racine County as Wisconsinites feel the pain of Bidenomics.”,"right"
“It’s no wonder why Biden is losing in Wisconsin and battleground states across the country: his policies have failed and people want President Trump back in office.”,"right"
Bryan Steil, who represents the district where Biden was visiting Wednesday, said the Microsoft announcement was good for workers.,"right"
But Steil said Biden is using it to hide his record on failing to control rising inflation and said Biden was taking credit for private-sector work in the region that began a decade ago, much of it for the Foxconn project.,"right"
Later, Biden met with about 50 Black supporters and volunteers at a community center in nearby Racine, noting that he first got into politics “because of the African American community.”,"right"
Biden was the first Democrat since 1976 to win Wisconsin without carrying Racine County.,"right"
Biden won by just under 21,000 votes in 2020.,"right"
Biden's trip to Wisconsin — his fourth of the year and 11th as president — came as his reelection also sharpened its outreach to minority voters on the airwaves.,"right"
By the end of May, Biden’s reelection effort will have more than 200 offices and roughly 500 staff members in place, according to Dan Kanninen, the campaign’s battleground director.,"right"
PARIS — President Biden arrived in France on Wednesday to join world leaders in commemorating the 80th anniversary of D-Day, a visit in which he plans to evoke the memory of allies united against tyranny to highlight the stakes of his election campaign.,"right"
Biden, wearing his trademark aviators and a blue suit, was welcomed at Orly airport by French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal.,"right"
Biden is also scheduled to deliver a speech on democracy and freedom on Friday, according to the White House, giving him an opportunity to put the struggle against authoritarianism in a global frame.,"right"
The theme of this week’s ceremonies — a brotherhood of nations united in sacrifice to beat back authoritarianism — is one that is factoring into European Parliament elections this week, as well as Biden’s message in his campaign against Trump.,"right"
The Biden campaign argues that the former president, who groundlessly denies his 2020 loss, is a would-be authoritarian who would end American democracy if he prevails.,"right"
Biden has regularly cited reports that the former president, during a visit to France when he occupied the White House, was reluctant to honor American service people buried at a French cemetery and reportedly called fallen soldiers “suckers” and “losers.”,"right"
But Biden again touched on the reports at a fundraiser in Connecticut on Monday.,"right"
Biden during his presidency has highlighted the task of rebuilding alliances damaged by Trump and working to restore America’s role as a world leader, rejecting Trump’s “America First” agenda and decrying him as a figure who was laughed at by his peers.,"right"
Biden has also criticized Trump for saying he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to NATO members if those countries are not spending their share on defense.,"right"
But as Biden arrived in France, he was at odds with other Western leaders over some of his own foreign policy positions, especially the U.S. role in conflagrations in Ukraine and Gaza.,"right"
Biden and Macron will discuss “the need for unwavering, long-term support for Ukraine,” according to the French government, but that comes as global support for a war inching toward the three-year mark has waned, including in the United States.,"right"
Biden has also taken political hits at home and abroad for his staunch support of Israel’s invasion of Gaza, as the death toll there has climbed above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.,"right"
Through it all, Biden’s trip is likely to draw comparisons to Trump’s travels to France during his presidential term.,"right"
Biden does not need to cite Trump by name to provide a vivid contrast with his predecessor’s “disastrous” appearances on the world stage, said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian.,"right"
“But [Biden] has to stay above the political fray.,"right"
Regardless, one of Biden’s final stops in France will be to lay a wreath at the World War I-era Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, the site that Trump skipped.,"right"
Biden is likely to receive a warmer welcome in France than Trump did.,"right"
The former president was unpopular with the French, while Biden, who invited Macron to Washington in 2022 for his administration’s first state visit, is generally well-liked here.,"right"
Biden’s strong backing of Ukraine has also earned him support in France, said Renaud Girard, an international columnist at the French newspaper Le Figaro.,"right"
“Biden will be well received because the majority of the French population, without being anti-Russian, found Russia’s aggression in 2022 unacceptable,” he said.,"right"
However, Biden could come up against a more divisive issue: the war in Gaza.,"right"
Biden’s strong support for Israel is at odds with the views of a section of French society, which believes Israel “has gone too far in its reprisals after Oct.,"right"
Some activist groups have planned protests this week, though they are not explicitly tied to Biden’s visit.,"right"
Still, said Girard, “the French public has understood that Biden has done everything possible to obtain a cease-fire,” including his recent announcement of a plan for a “durable end to the war.” In France, “Biden is not equated with Netanyahu,” Girard said.,"right"
Biden, who like Reagan at the time has struggled with low approval ratings on foreign policy and is seeking reelection, plans to deliver remarks at Pointe du Hoc as well.,"right"
Reagan went on to win reelection in a landslide, something Biden is no doubt hoping to replicate, said Brinkley, whose book “The Boys of Pointe du Hoc” examined Reagan’s speech and the U.S. troops who fought there.,"right"
“This is Biden’ s opportunity to showcase a soulful understanding of the cost of war,” he said.,"right"
LUANDA, Angola — Joe Biden on Tuesday used the first visit to Angola by a U.S. president to promote billions of dollars of investments in the sub-Saharan African nation and speak at a slavery museum, where he'll acknowledge the trafficking of humans that once linked the nations' economies.,"right"
“The United States is all in on Africa,” Biden told Angolan President João Lourenço, who called Biden's visit a key turning point in U.S.-Angola relations dating back to the Cold War.,"right"
Biden will visit the coastal city of Lobito on Wednesday for a look at the corridor's Atlantic Ocean outlet.,"right"
That means much of it may fall to Biden's successor, Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan.,"right"
Asked whether the project could proceed without support from Trump, Kirby said it was the Biden administration's hope “that they see the value too, that they see how it will help drive a more secure, more prosperous, more economically stable continent.”,"right"
The streets of the capital, Luanda, had a heavy presence of soldiers but few civilians — a striking change from Biden’s arrival on Monday night, when cheering onlookers lined the road from the airport.,"right"
Biden and Lourenco briefly addressed reporters before a closed-door meeting in the pink-hued presidential palace.,"right"
We don’t think we have all the answers,” Biden told Lourenco, pledging to use the trip to listen.,"right"
He praised Biden’s “vision and leadership” on the Lobito corridor, saying it would “always be remembered.”,"right"
Biden had promised to visit Africa last year, after reviving the U.S.-Africa Summit in December 2022.,"right"
Biden attended a United Nations climate summit in Egypt in North Africa in 2022.,"right"
Later Tuesday, Biden was visiting Angola’s National Slavery Museum.,"right"
Kirby said Biden will give a speech there acknowledging “both the horrific history of slavery that has connected our two nations, but also looks forward to a future predicated on a shared vision that benefits both our people.”,"right"
Biden also met briefly with Wanda Tucker, a descendant of William Tucker, the first enslaved child born in the United States, the White House said.,"right"
WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris, who presents herself as the candidate of change as she runs for president against Republican Donald Trump, said Friday that she's different from President Joe Biden because she offers “a new generation of leadership.”,"right"
“Well, I'm obviously not Joe Biden” and “I offer a new generation of leadership,” Harris said, adding that things once taken for granted cannot be overlooked anymore.,"right"
— President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden joined grieving families at Dover Air Force Base on Friday to honor the three American service members killed in a drone attack in Jordan.,"right"
The Bidens arrived at the base Friday afternoon to witness the transfer of the remains of the troops killed in Sunday's assault.,"right"
CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, joined the Bidens for the transfer in Dover.,"right"
The Bidens met privately with the families before the ceremony.,"right"
Unbending in their commitment to our country — risking their own safety for the safety of their fellow Americans, and our allies and partners with whom we stand in the fight against terrorism,” Biden said earlier this week.,"right"
At Thursday’s National Prayer Breakfast at the Capitol, Biden acknowledged Rivers, Moffett and Sanders by name, again vowing to never forget their sacrifice to the nation.,"right"
Friday is the second dignified transfer Biden attended as president.,"right"
As vice president, Biden in 2016 attended a dignified transfer for two U.S. soldiers killed in a suicide blast at Bagram Airfield.,"right"
While Biden and White House officials have stressed that they don’t want a broader war with Iran, the administration has also warned that it will respond to the deadly assault.,"right"
WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden brushed off a threat from Russian leader Vladimir Putin about war against the West if Ukraine’s allies allow it to use weapons deeper inside Russia.,"right"
It's a shift that Kyiv has pleaded for, but no decision was immediately announced following a meeting Friday between Biden and Britain’s prime minister.,"right"
Ukraine and many of its supporters in the U.S. and Europe want Biden to lift restrictions on Western-provided long-range weapons, and there are signs Biden might shift the administration's policy.,"right"
Ukraine was a key topic for Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer after this week’s visit to Kyiv by their top diplomats, who came under fresh pressure to loosen weapons restrictions.,"right"
Two U.S. officials familiar with discussions said they believed Starmer was seeking Biden’s approval to allow Ukraine to use British Storm Shadow missiles for expanded strikes in Russia.,"right"
Biden's approval may be needed because Storm Shadow components are made in the U.S. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to share the status of private conversations, said they believed Biden would be amenable.,"right"
Speaking to journalists before the private talks with Starmer, Biden said he wanted to make “clear that Putin will not prevail in this war.”,"right"
Asked what he thought about Putin’s threat, Biden answered, “I don’t think much about Vladimir Putin.”,"right"
Biden and Starmer, meeting for the second time since his center-left government was elected in July, also were set to compare notes on languishing efforts to get a cease-fire deal in Gaza, mutual concerns in the Indo-Pacific and other issues.,"right"
Biden, however, has hinted that a change could be afoot.,"right"
Some American supporters of Ukraine have criticized the Biden administration for telegraphing earlier decisions on beefing up weapons to Kyiv well in advance, saying the U.S. was giving Russia ample time to update its tactics accordingly.,"right"
The Biden administration said this week that Iran recently delivered short-range ballistic weapons to Russia to use against Ukraine, a transfer that White House officials worry will allow Russia to use more of its arsenal for targets far beyond the Ukrainian front line while employing Iranian warheads for closer-range targets.,"right"
In a speech that began by focusing on how "words matter" in the wake of bomb threats and the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, former Vice President Joe Biden used his own words to address a health care issue that has become a focal point in the 14th Congressional District race.,"right"
Biden appeared Wednesday at the Kane County Fairgrounds in St. Charles to help rally support for Democrat Lauren Underwood.,"right"
Biden's speech noted recent acts of violence and called for all politicians to realize that "our opponents are not our enemies; they are our opponents." But it was his focus on health care that drew the loudest roars from the audience of about 1,400 people.,"right"
Biden said any Republican who, like Hultgren, claims the GOP-backed American Health Care Act would have guaranteed coverage of pre-existing conditions is "simply lying about their commitment to pre-existing conditions.","right"
"It's simply not true," Biden said.,"right"
Biden went on to say that dismantling the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is just the first step Republicans will take to slash government spending in an effort to provide financial support to tax cuts for the wealthy.,"right"
"They've never supported Medicare wholeheartedly," Biden said.,"right"
In an interview after the rally, Underwood said she supports what Biden had to say about the Republican view of health care coverage.,"right"
Biden's comments hit many of the points Pamela Dale showed up to hear an emphasis on.,"right"
WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris appears to have energized Democrats in the early days of her candidacy, with the surge in warm feelings extending across multiple groups, including some key Democratic constituencies that had been especially tepid about President Joe Biden, a new poll shows.,"right"
About 8 in 10 Democrats say they would be somewhat or very satisfied if Harris became the Democratic nominee for president, according to the survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which was conducted after Biden withdrew from the race.,"right"
In a separate AP-NORC poll, taken before Biden dropped out but after his debate against Republican former President Donald Trump, only about 4 in 10 Democrats said they were somewhat or very satisfied that he was the Democratic Party’s likely nominee for president.,"right"
Gary Hines, a Democrat from Philadelphia, said he wasn't particularly impressed by Harris' first presidential bid but now, she's shown “she's up to the task, can do the work, has proven that she's running a strong campaign so far and maybe on a bigger level, she's somebody that can beat Donald Trump.” All those factors have ignited an enthusiasm in Hines that wasn't there when Biden was still in the race, he said.,"right"
Lauren Schulman, a Democrat from Pompano Beach, Florida, said she admires Biden and what he has accomplished during his presidency.,"right"
Growing enthusiasm for Harris — especially compared to Biden,"right"
About 7 in 10 Black adults and about half of Hispanic adults would be satisfied with Harris as the Democratic nominee — a marked increase from earlier in July, when about half of Black adults and 15% of Hispanic adults felt satisfied with Biden as the Democrats’ expected nominee.,"right"
The share of younger adults (those under the age of 45) who say they would be satisfied with Harris as the nominee, at around 4 in 10, is higher than the 17% who said they were satisfied with Biden in July.,"right"
Views of Biden’s decision,"right"
Most Americans, 54%, say they have heard or read a lot about Biden’s decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race.,"right"
For many Democrats, Biden’s catastrophic June 27 debate showed that — even if they were largely satisfied with his accomplishments during his time in office — the incumbent president should not be running for a second term because of concerns about how his age was affecting his public performance or his ability to campaign effectively against Trump.,"right"
Biden's choice to endorse Harris as the Democratic nominee for president is slightly more divisive, with about half of U.S. adults in support, though Democrats overwhelmingly approve.,"right"
There are similar levels of support for Biden’s decision to serve out the rest of his presidential term.,"right"
Withdrawing from the race didn't do much to change Americans' views of Biden overall.,"right"
About 4 in 10 Americans approve of how Biden is handling his job as president.,"right"
Biden’s favorability ratings are similar to where they were before he dropped out of the race, with about 4 in 10 adults and about three-quarters of Democrats holding a positive view.,"right"
Joe Manchin, a Democrat turned independent, urged President Joe Biden on Sunday to drop his reelection bid and focus on the remaining months of his presidency.,"right"
Nearly three dozen Democrats in Congress have said it's time for Biden to leave the race.,"right"
Biden's debate performance raised open questions about the 81-year-old's ability to mount a convincing campaign to defeat Trump.,"right"
Biden has insisted he can defeat Trump in a rematch from 2020 and has been meeting with family and longtime aides as he resist effort to push him aside.,"right"
Nonetheless, Manchin said Biden should clear the way for other Democrats and spend the remainder of his term as “the president he always wanted to be, be able to unite the country, bring it back together, to be able to maybe spend all of his time on solving the problems in Gaza, bringing peace to Gaza and to the Middle East.,"right"
President Joe Biden last week spent time in Michigan supporting striking autoworkers.,"right"
During the event, Biden addressed the crowd.,"right"
"I marched a lot of UAW picket lines when I was a senator - since 1973 - but I tell you what, it's the first time I've ever done it as president," Biden said.,"right"
"Biden today: 'I marched a lot of UAW picket lines when I was a Senator since 1973.,"right"
But Biden can clearly be heard saying "as president" on a video posted by C-SPAN.,"right"
While slowing down the audio, Biden distinctly says the three-syllable word "president," not the two-syllable word "person," Reuters said.,"right"
PHOENIX (AP) - Arizona officials certified the state's election results on Monday, formalizing Democrat Joe Biden's narrow victory over Donald Trump even as the Republican president's attorneys continued to make baseless claims of fraud about the state's vote count.,"right"
Biden is only the second Democrat in 70 years to win Arizona.,"right"
14 to formally cast Arizona's electoral votes for Biden.,"right"
A judge in Phoenix has scheduled a Thursday trial in Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward's lawsuit that seeks to annul Biden's victory in the state.,"right"
The lawsuit against Biden's 11 electors in Arizona asks for an inspection of mail-in ballot signatures and duplicated ballots in metro Phoenix, home to 61 percent of Arizona's voters.,"right"
It was bad news for President Joe Biden, since the influential entertainer, who describes herself as Afro-Latina, endorsed him in 2020.,"right"
At 31, Ms. B stands out as one of many younger and minority Americans who feel that the Biden administration isn't delivering what they wanted.,"right"
A more recent Times/Siena sampling of voters under age 45 found that 70% disapprove of Biden.,"right"
Team Biden is acutely aware of the need to boost enthusiasm — and participation — among these two heavily Democratic-leaning demographics.,"right"
It's natural to wonder if democracy you hear about actually works for you,” Biden, 81, told the graduates and their families.,"right"
Of course, Biden is free to engage in grievance politics, but his remarks about democracy not working for Black people may have turned off those who see more progress than the president chose to acknowledge.,"right"
It's instructive that Biden's speech generated what Politico described as “mild applause” among Morehouse graduates, a small number of whom turned their backs as Biden spoke, while others wore pro-Palestinian accessories.,"right"
The Morehouse remarks were the 2024 version of Biden's efforts to woo Black voters in 2020, when he told radio talk-show host Charlamagne tha God, “If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't Black.”,"right"
Back to Biden and his efforts to retain a hold on registered Black voters who, according to Pew, say they would prefer to vote for Biden over Trump by a margin of 77% to 18%.,"right"
Biden can't afford to lose a modest percentage of that voting bloc, so Biden is resorting to fearmongering.,"right"
WARSAW, Poland - President Joe Biden's visit to Poland on Friday gave him a chance to underscore the U.S. commitment to protect a key NATO member on Ukraine's doorstep and to thank Poles for their generous welcome to refugees fleeing Russia's invasion.,"right"
Biden's two-day visit follows a trio of emergency summits in Brussels and brought him to the country that has accepted the lion's share of the more than 3.5 million people who have fled Ukraine.,"right"
President Andrzej Duda, who is allied with a right-wing political party accused of eroding democratic norms, and who clearly preferred former U.S. President Donald Trump to Biden, was set to welcome his American counterpart upon Air Force One's arrival in Rzeszow, a city some 70 kilometers (45 miles) from the border with Ukraine.,"right"
The delay forced Biden to change his schedule and to meet before a briefing on the humanitarian crisis facing Ukrainians with American soldiers who are serving alongside Polish troops on NATO's eastern flank.,"right"
The soldiers Biden met are among thousands of additional U.S. troops deployed due to Russia's war in Ukraine and come in addition to thousands deployed on a rotating basis since Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014.,"right"
At the same time, many Poles will be hoping for a sign from Biden that Washington will continue to urge the Polish government's adherence to democratic values, hoping that won't be forgotten amid the need for wartime NATO unity.,"right"
During his election campaign, Biden mentioned Poland along with Belarus and Hungary in warning about "the rise of totalitarian regimes in the world." The comment caused offense to leaders in Poland, which has become a refuge for dissidents from authoritarian Belarus.,"right"
Biden, however, will likely not have forgotten that Duda and other Polish officials were ardent supporters and ideological brethren of Trump, particularly in their opposition to accepting Middle Eastern refugees and migrants.,"right"
Duda was among a handful of leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, who waited weeks before congratulating Biden after he won the 2020 election, taking a wait-and-see approach as Trump refused to accept his defeat.,"right"
They hope Biden's visit to Poland will bring stronger military commitments.,"right"
Before Biden returns to Washington on Saturday, he is expected to address the Polish people.,"right"
WASHINGTON — Joe Biden's name wasn't on the ballot, but history will likely remember Kamala Harris' resounding defeat as his loss too.,"right"
As Democrats pick up the pieces after President-elect Donald Trump's decisive victory, some of the vice president's backers are expressing frustration that Biden's decision to seek reelection until this summer — despite long-standing voter concerns about his age and unease about post-pandemic inflation as well as the U.S.-Mexico border — all but sealed his party's surrender of the White House.,"right"
“The biggest onus of this loss is on President Biden,” said Andrew Yang, who ran against Biden in 2020 for the Democratic nomination and endorsed Harris’ unsuccessful run.,"right"
Biden will leave office after leading the United States out of the worst pandemic in a century, galvanizing international support for Ukraine after Russia’s invasion and passing a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that will affect communities for years to come.,"right"
But having run four years ago against Trump to “restore the soul of the country,” Biden will make way after just one term for his immediate predecessor, who overcame two impeachments, a felony conviction and an insurrection launched by his supporters.,"right"
Trump has pledged to radically reshape the federal government and roll back many of Biden's priorities.,"right"
“Maybe in 20 or 30 years, history will remember Biden for some of these achievements,” said Thom Reilly, co-director of the Center for an Independent and Sustainable Democracy at Arizona State University.,"right"
Biden on Thursday avoided directly addressing the electorate's seeming repudiation of his presidency.,"right"
“Don’t forget all that we accomplished,” Biden said in a brief Rose Garden address attended by Cabinet members and top aides but not by Harris.,"right"
Biden aides believe Democrats got caught up in a wave of anti-incumbency in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic that upturned governments in democracies around the globe irrespective of ideology.,"right"
Biden tried for years to counteract the trend before stepping aside to give Harris a chance, but in hindsight they view the headwinds facing the party in power as having been insurmountable.,"right"
Only about 4 in 10 voters in the 2024 presidential election approved of how Biden handled his job as president, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide.,"right"
Roughly 6 in 10 disapproved, and Donald Trump won a strong majority of those voters who were dissatisfied with Biden.,"right"
Some high-ranking Democrats, including three advisers to the Harris campaign, expressed deep frustration with Biden for failing to recognize earlier in the election cycle that he was not up to the challenge.,"right"
Biden, 81, ended his reelection campaign in July, weeks after an abysmal debate performance sent his party into a spiral and raised questions about whether he still had the mental acuity and stamina to serve as a credible nominee.,"right"
Some 77% of Americans said in August 2023 that Biden was too old to be effective for four more years, according to a poll by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs.,"right"
Biden endorsed Harris and handed over his campaign operation to her.,"right"
Yang argued that Democratic Party leaders also deserve blame for taking too long to push out Biden.,"right"
Dean Phillips, Democrats shied away talking publicly about Biden's age.,"right"
Bernie Sanders, an ally of Biden and Harris, said in a statement that Democrats lost the thread on working-class Americans' concerns.,"right"
Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison took to social media Thursday to push back on Sanders' critique, saying that Biden was “the most-pro worker President of my lifetime.”,"right"
Harris managed to spur far greater enthusiasm than Biden was generating from the party's base.,"right"
But she struggled to distinguish how her administration would differ from Biden's.,"right"
Appearing on ABC’s “The View” in September, Harris was not able to identify a decision where she would have separated herself from Biden.,"right"
Had Biden stepped aside early in the year, they said, it would have given Democrats enough time to hold a primary.,"right"
Going through the paces of an intraparty contest would have forced Harris or another eventual nominee to more aggressively stake out differences with Biden.,"right"
Still, they said that Biden had left Democrats in an untenable place.,"right"
Some of it was Biden’s making and some maybe not," said Bennett, who served as an aide to Vice President Al Gore during the Clinton administration.,"right"
“Would Democrats fare better if Biden had stepped back earlier?,"right"
ATLANTA — Already reeling from their November defeats, Democrats now are grappling with President Joe Biden’s pardoning of his son for federal crimes, with some calling the move misguided and unwise after the party spent years slamming Donald Trump as a threat to democracy who disregarded the law.,"right"
The president pardoned Hunter Biden late Sunday evening, reversing his previous pledges with a grant of clemency that covers more than a decade of any federal crimes his son might have committed.,"right"
“He believes in the justice system, but he also believes that politics infected the process and led to a miscarriage of justice,” said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who along with Biden and other White House officials insisted for months that Hunter Biden would not get a pardon.,"right"
That explanation did not satisfy some Democrats, angry that Biden’s reversal could make it harder to take on Trump, who has argued that multiple indictments and one conviction against him were a matter of Biden and Democrats turning the justice system against him.,"right"
Jared Polis wrote of Biden on the social media platform X.,"right"
Michael Bennet said Biden “put personal interest ahead of duty” with a decision that “further erodes Americans’ faith that the justice system is fair and equal for all.”,"right"
Peter Welch, D-Vt., called the pardon “understandable” if viewed only as the “action of a loving father.” But Biden's status as “our nation's Chief Executive,” the senator said, rendered the move “unwise.”,"right"
Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison said there “is no standard for Donald Trump, and the highest standard for Democrats and Joe Biden.” Harrison pointed to Trump's apparent plans to oust FBI Director Christopher Wray and replace him with loyalist Kash Patel and suggested the GOP's pursuit of Hunter Biden would not have ended without clemency.,"right"
“Most people will see that Joe Biden did what was right,” Harrison said.,"right"
First lady Jill Biden said Monday from the White House: “Of course I support the pardon of my son.”,"right"
Before beating Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump faced his own legal troubles, including two cases that stemmed from his efforts to overturn his defeat to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.,"right"
In June, President Biden firmly ruled out a pardon or commutation for his son, telling reporters as his son faced trial in the Delaware gun case, “I abide by the jury decision.,"right"
8, days after Trump’s victory, Jean-Pierre ruled out a pardon or clemency for the younger Biden, saying, “We’ve been asked that question multiple times.,"right"
The president’s about-face came weeks before Hunter Biden was set to receive his punishment after his trial conviction in the gun case and guilty plea on tax charges.,"right"
It capped a long-running legal saga for the younger Biden, who disclosed he was under federal investigation in December 2020 — a month after his father’s 2020 victory.,"right"
The sweeping pardon covers not just the gun and tax offenses against the younger Biden, but also any other “offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from Jan.,"right"
Hunter Biden was convicted in June in Delaware federal court of three felonies for purchasing a gun in 2018 when, prosecutors said, he lied on a federal form by claiming he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs.,"right"
In his statement Sunday, the president argued that such offenses typically are not prosecuted with the same vigor as was directed against Hunter Biden.,"right"
“The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election,” Biden said in his statement.,"right"
WASHINGTON — Movie star and lifelong Democrat George Clooney added his voice to calls for Joe Biden to leave the presidential race on Wednesday.,"right"
Clooney said in a New York Times opinion piece that he loves Biden, but the party would lose the presidential race as well as any control in Congress with him as the nominee.,"right"
He's hosted several high-dollar Hollywood fundraisers, including for Biden last month.,"right"
Biden has refused to end his reelection bid after his weak debate performance against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.,"right"
It's been about a year since Joe Biden took office as President and though it's still too early to draw firm conclusions about his performance, it's not too early to discern some trends.,"right"
Especially in light of how Biden positioned himself in the 2020 campaign and, I believe, how he still sees himself: as a centrist and a moderate who can unite the country by bringing professionalism to the White House and make the federal government work.,"right"
He began his presidency with, overall, a lot of good will: Many Americans longed for an end to the tumult of the Trump presidency and, as Biden himself put it, a return to normalcy.,"right"
But neither Biden nor the Democrats in the majority have been able to capitalize on this turn of events to boost their public standing.,"right"
President Biden is experienced in foreign affairs and has put together a competent, professional team that's more interested in getting things done quietly than in tweeting about their plans.,"right"
Biden clearly favors diplomacy to protect American interests, wants to protect human rights and aims to promote democracy in our dealings with other nations - hence his tough stance toward both Russia and China, but with a clear preference for sustaining ties.,"right"
While I'd argue that Biden's policies have generally been both bold and smart, judging them will depend on how events play out over the next year or more.,"right"
This will be vital to Biden's tenure in the White House.,"right"
Like fellow tech titan Elon Musk, Andreessen has come to see the Democrats as “the ones who are trying to silence free speech.” However, unlike many Trump supporters, he does not fasten upon the obvious partisan example: Secretary of State Antony Blinken's 2020 campaign enlistment of 51 current or former intelligence officials to depict Hunter Biden's laptop as bearing “the hallmarks of Russian disinformation.”,"right"
That Democratic disinformation operation suppressed facts about Biden family corruption during the campaign year, but not forever, as President Joe Biden's pardon of his son showed.,"right"
One can argue further that, unlike the Hunter Biden laptop coverup, this was not necessarily a partisan operation: It began during the Trump presidency and was uncovered in part by actions of the Biden administration.,"right"
WASHINGTON - The Electoral College decisively confirmed Joe Biden as the nation's next president, ratifying his November victory in an authoritative state-by-state repudiation of President Donald Trump's refusal to concede he had lost.,"right"
The presidential electors on Monday gave Biden a solid majority of 306 electoral votes to Trump's 232, the same margin that Trump bragged was a landslide when he won the White House four years ago.,"right"
For all Trump's unsupported claims of fraud, there was little suspense and no change as every one of the electoral votes allocated to Biden and the president in last month's popular vote went officially to each man.,"right"
California's 55 electoral votes put Biden over the top.,"right"
Our democracy - pushed, tested, threatened - proved to be resilient, true, and strong," Biden said in an evening speech in which he stressed the size of his win and the record 81 million people who voted for him.,"right"
On Monday in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - the six battleground states that Biden won and Trump contested - electors gave Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris their votes in low-key proceedings.,"right"
Biden won the state by 154,000 votes, or 2.8 percentage points, over Trump.,"right"
Georgia state police were out in force at the state Capitol in Atlanta before Democratic electors pledged to Biden met.,"right"
Even with the Electoral College's confirmation of Biden's victory, some Republicans continued to refuse to acknowledge that reality.,"right"
Yet their opposition to Biden had no practical effect on the electoral process, with the Democrat to be sworn in next month.,"right"
Republicans who would have been Trump electors met anyway in a handful of states Biden won.,"right"
Pennsylvania Republicans said they cast a "procedural vote" for Trump and Pence in case courts that have repeatedly rejected challenges to Biden's victory were to somehow still determine that Trump had won.,"right"
Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whom Trump defeated four years ago, were among New York's 29 electors for Biden and Harris.,"right"
In New Hampshire, before the state's four electors voted for Biden at the State House in Concord, 13-year-old Brayden Harrington led the group in the Pledge of Allegiance.,"right"
He had delivered a moving speech at the Democratic National Convention in August about the struggle with stuttering he shares with Biden.,"right"
Following weeks of Republican legal challenges that were easily dismissed by judges, Trump and Republican allies tried to persuade the Supreme Court last week to set aside 62 electoral votes for Biden in four states, which might have thrown the outcome into doubt.,"right"
NEW YORK — President Joe Biden begins an intense period of private preparations Friday at Camp David for what may be the most consequential presidential debate in decades.,"right"
Biden's team expects aggressive attacks on his physical and mental strength, his record on the economy and immigration and even his family.,"right"
A coin flip determined Biden would stand at the podium to the viewer’s right, while Trump would deliver the final closing statement.,"right"
Biden arrived at Camp David on Thursday night and is expected to hunker down with senior campaign aides until the debate.,"right"
One adviser not authorized to speak publicly about debate strategy noted Biden has been increasingly punchier in recent remarks about Trump and plans to carry that theme through to the debate.,"right"
Among some political operatives, there's the sense Biden may have more to lose given his struggle to generate momentum amid signs of weakness within his political coalition.,"right"
Trump and his allies have set an extraordinarily low bar, however, by suggesting for months Biden is contending with serious physical limitations that make it difficult for him to stand for 90 minutes or string together two sentences.,"right"
Put a mirror under Biden’s nose, and if it fogs it up, he wins, right?,"right"
That’s about what the threshold is for Biden,” Republican strategist and Trump ally David Urban said with a laugh.,"right"
“Can Biden demonstrate that he’s mentally nimble?,"right"
Yet Trump sought to shift expectations in a Thursday interview with the “The All-In Podcast” in which he veered sharply away from his typical Biden taunts.,"right"
He said Biden “destroyed” vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan in their 2012 debate.,"right"
“I assume he’s going to be somebody that will be a worthy debater,” Trump said of Biden.,"right"
Biden's aides have dismissed concerns about his age and mental readiness.,"right"
But while some Democrats project confidence, Biden's allies also say he has spent much of the last two weeks traveling — in Europe and on the West Coast — limiting his ability to prepare.,"right"
He suggested Trump was taking an unnecessary political risk by debating Biden, given Trump’s early advantage in many polls.,"right"
Trump’s team sees the faceoff as an opportunity to demonstrate a clear contrast with Biden's leadership ability and governing record.,"right"
“Biden needs rehearsals with handlers to find some way to explain this mess he’s made of our nation,” Trump spokesman Brian Hughes said.,"right"

Biden's camp is aware Trump will likely focus on his son Hunter, as the then-president did on the debate stage four years ago.,"right"
Hunter Biden was recently convicted on three felony charges related to the purchase of a gun while allegedly being addicted to drugs.,"right"
Republicans have also criticized Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings when Joe Biden was vice president.,"right"
Biden's allies are also concerned, however, their famously combative rival might be on good behavior.,"right"
“For both campaigns, the goal here is reaching an audience of moderate, independent, swing voters in swing states who will, in many ways, be the deciding factor in this election,” said former Biden administration official Bill Russo.,"right"
The only collar county where the majority voted Republican in the 2020 presidential election was McHenry and that's where Democratic President Joe Biden is headed Wednesday on his first official visit to Illinois since his inauguration.,"right"
"This is about Joe Biden getting out there talking about his vision for what's important and talking to the American people.","right"
Biden garnered 47.7% of the vote in 2020 in McHenry and former President Donald Trump received 50.2%.,"right"
Biden is scheduled to speak at McHenry County College in Crystal Lake and possibly indulge his taste for ice cream at a local haunt, one memo circulated among state Democrats suggested.,"right"

I am glad President Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter.,"right"
Besides, I never believed Biden when he said he wouldn't pardon his son.,"right"
In 2019, Biden said he had "never spoken" to Hunter about his business dealings.,"right"
I don't blame Joe Biden for flipping on the pardon so much as I blame Hunter Biden for walking away from a plea deal on gun and tax evasion charges that would have spared him from prison time.,"right"
In the pardon statement, Biden offered that he pardoned his son because a 2023 plea deal "unraveled in the courtroom" -- without mentioning that his arrogant, entitled princeling of a son walked away from the package, even though, as Biden wrote Sunday, the deal "would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter's cases.","right"
I have another beef: the Bidens' lack of introspection.,"right"
POTUS claims Hunter was "singled out" because he is Biden's son -- without recognizing that his son was cashing in because he was Biden's son.,"right"
Biden also claimed that he made the decision to pardon Hunter over the holiday weekend.,"right"
On 2Way's "The Morning Meeting," which streams on YouTube, Democratic strategist Dan Turrentine called the pardon "incredibly selfish" and added that Biden's decision to run for reelection, announced in 2023, also was incredibly selfish.,"right"

WASHINGTON — Ukraine’s push to ease restrictions on the use of weapons from the United States and Britain will be discussed Friday in White House talks between President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Keir Starmer.,"right"
Ukraine and many of its supporters in the U.S. and Europe want Biden to let Kyiv use the weapons to strike military targets deeper inside Russia, and there are signs Biden might shift U.S. policy.,"right"
Two U.S. officials familiar with discussions about the weapons said they believe Starmer will seek Biden’s approval to allow Ukraine to use British Storm Shadow missiles for expanded strikes in Russia.,"right"
Biden's approval is needed because Storm Shadow components are made in the U.S. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to share the status of private conversations, said they believed Biden would be amenable.,"right"
Blinken said he had “no doubt” that Biden and Starmer would discuss the matter, noting the U.S. has adapted and “will adjust as necessary” as Russia’s battlefield strategy has changed.,"right"
Biden also has hinted that a change could be afoot.,"right"
Starmer, meeting with Biden for the second time since his center-left government was elected in July, said he was visiting Washington for strategic meetings focusing on Ukraine and the Middle East.,"right"
The White House talks were scheduled in part to help Biden and Starmer compare notes on the war in Ukraine, the languishing efforts to get a cease-fire deal in Gaza, mutual concerns in the Indo-Pacific and other issues before this month's annual meeting of global leaders at the U.N. General Assembly.,"right"
The Biden administration said this week that Iran recently delivered short-range ballistic weapons to Russia to use against Ukraine, a transfer that White House officials worry will allow Russia to use more of its arsenal for targets far beyond the Ukrainian front line while employing Iranian warheads for closer-range targets.,"right"
LAS VEGAS (AP) - Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday counted superstar singer Lady Gaga among the bravest survivors he knows for her role in raising awareness about sexual assault on college campuses.,"right"
Biden has been heavily promoting the initiative that urges people to support sexual assault victims and intervene when consent is questionable.,"right"
"Imagine the courage it takes for her to speak out and then imagine the courage it takes for her to sing a song, 'Til It Happens to You,' that is branded in her heart," Biden said as he introduced the singer at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas' Cox Pavilion.,"right"
Biden spoke for 40 minutes about the "sick cultural norm" of sexual assault, including stigma and passive attitudes and asked the crowd to pledge to be an active voice in incidents they witness or know about.,"right"
At the Academy Awards in February, Biden announced her performance of the song that appeared in "The Hunting Ground," a documentary about sexual assault on college campuses.,"right"
Biden and Lady Gaga partnered up after the vice president met Diane Warren, the song's lead writer, last fall at an "It's On Us" event, according to Biden's office.,"right"
Domestic violence prevention has been a signature issue for Biden since he championed the Violence Against Women Act in the Senate in 1994.,"right"
WASHINGTON — House Republicans have released their initial impeachment inquiry report on President Joe Biden, alleging an abuse of power and obstruction of justice in the financial dealings of his son Hunter Biden and family associates.,"right"
Instead, the almost 300-page report out Monday, the opening day of the Democratic National Convention, covers familiar ground, asserting the Biden family traded on its “brand” in business ventures in corrupt ways that rise to the Constitution’s high bar for impeachment.,"right"
With Biden no longer running for reelection, next steps are highly uncertain.,"right"
Republicans have spent the better part of their time in the House majority with a hyper focus on Biden and his family’s businesses, encouraged by Donald Trump as the twice impeached and indicted former president makes a comeback bid for the White House.,"right"
Republicans are investigating many aspects of Biden family finances going back to 2009 when he was vice president to Barack Obama.,"right"
Through bank records, interviews from some 30 witnesses, whistleblower accounts and millions of documents, House Republicans allege a yearslong practice by Hunter Biden and his associates to solicit foreign business deals using the family’s proximity to power in Washington.,"right"
Much of the focus of the report is not on Biden's time as president, but on the years when the Biden family was in turmoil after the 2015 death of his oldest son, Beau, and as the vice president was bowing out of elected office, declining to run for president in 2016.,"right"
Hunter Biden has acknowledged a serious addiction to crack in these years.,"right"
Former Hunter Biden associate Devon Archer, who was sentenced to a year in prison in 2022 in another matter, told the committee, “At the end of the day, part of what was delivered is the brand.”,"right"
To tie the elder Biden to his son’s actions, the Republicans rely on a series of phone calls and pop-by dinner meeting visits Joe Biden made while Hunter was conducting business.,"right"
The Bidens are a famously tight-knit family and acknowledge they speak almost daily, including during this time, with the father checking on his son’s well-being.,"right"
In his own defiant closed-door deposition to House investigators, Hunter Biden insisted he did not involve his father in his business.,"right"
All told, the House Republicans allege the Biden family and its associates received some $27 million in business payments from partners or clients in Russia, China and other countries.,"right"
They allege an additional $8 million in loans, including some from Hunter Biden benefactor Kevin Morris, a Hollywood attorney, and question the purchases of the son’s artwork.,"right"
The report said it is “inconceivable” that President Biden did not understand what was going on.,"right"
“President Biden participated in a conspiracy to monetize his office of public trust to enrich his family,” the report claims.,"right"
Biden himself declined a request to testify before the House.,"right"
Touchbacks to Trump’s impeachments at the hands of Democrats run throughout the report’s pages as Republicans work to contrast his grounds for removal to Biden family’s dealings and “grift.”,"right"
But the difference are stark, as the indicted Trump faces actual criminal charges, including in the conspiracy to overturn Biden’s 2020 election and draw supporters to Washington on the day of the Jan.,"right"
The report also accuses Biden of obstructing justice in the probe, revisiting previously aired complaints about the Justice Department’s handling of the investigation into Hunter Biden.,"right"
But the report provides no evidence that Biden had any involvement in his son’s investigation, which was launched under Trump’s presidency and has been led by a Delaware U.S. attorney appointed by Trump.,"right"
Garland has insisted that no one at the White House gave him or other senior officials at the Justice Department direction about the handling of the Hunter Biden investigation.,"right"
Beyond Hunter Biden, the report includes details of the involvement of Joe Biden’s brother, James, in the various family businesses.,"right"
They point to a $200,000 personal check from James Biden to Joe Biden on the same day in 2018 that James Biden received an equal amount from Americore, a health care company.,"right"
House Democrats have defended the transaction, pointing to bank records they say indicate James Biden was repaying a loan provided by his brother, who had wire transferred $200,000 to him about six weeks earlier.,"right"
The money changed hands while Joe Biden was a private citizen.,"right"
Short of impeaching Biden, the House Republicans have issued criminal referrals recommending the Justice Department prosecute Hunter Biden and James Biden, accusing them of making false statements to Congress as part of the GOP investigation.,"right"
A year ago, GOP lawmakers had hoped the Biden inquiry would build a strong enough case for impeachment’s “high crimes and misdemeanors.” But the longer the inquiry dragged and the little direct evidence against Biden investigators were able to produce in public hearings or even in closed-door sessions, the more concerns grew from moderate Republicans wary of a vote on the matter.,"right"
The report released Monday makes more than 20 mentions of the “Biden-Harris administration,” while previous releases from the committees investigating Biden typically only made direct references to him.,"right"
Marco Rubio illustrated this immediately after Trump's convictions, which, kissing The Big Guy's ring, Rubio blamed on Joe Biden.,"right"
Joe Biden is not only an extraordinarily decent man, but he has been a hugely successful president, even historically successful, the more impressive given the awful sociopolitical hand he was dealt when inaugurated in January 2021.,"right"
Joe Biden, Graham said then, is “as good a man as God ever created.”,"right"
It's also because of Democrats' hubris and their failure to confront the revulsion that far-left groups that America's heartland associates with the Democratic Party has triggered in states Biden needs to carry to win reelection.,"right"
A fear that chaos and lunacy on the left is what Democrats stand for isn't just an albatross around Joe Biden's neck as November draws near.,"right"
Biden doesn't deserve this.,"right"
WASHINGTON — A House Democratic lawmaker has become the first in the party to publicly call for President Joe Biden to step down as the party's nominee for president, citing Biden’s debate performance against Donald Trump failing to “effectively defend his many accomplishments.”,"right"
Lloyd Doggett of Texas said in a statement Tuesday that Biden should “make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw.”,"right"
“My decision to make these strong reservations public is not done lightly nor does it in any way diminish my respect for all that President Biden has achieved,” Doggett said.,"right"
“Recognizing that, unlike Trump, President Biden’s first commitment has always been to our country, not himself, I am hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw.,"right"
Biden’s weak performance caused an immediate panic among even his most ardent supporters, leading many to question whether the 81-year-old career politician is the strongest Democratic candidate to take on Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, in November.,"right"
Biden himself conceded the debate didn't go well for him, but he insisted he was ready to fight for a second term as president.,"right"
Biden and his campaign have not directly responded to Democrats’ criticism of his performance, choosing instead to send surrogates on cable news to defend it as a bad night and draw a clear contrast between him and Trump.,"right"
Doggett's explosive statement came minutes after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told MSNBC that she believes “it is a legitimate question” whether Biden's halting performance is just “an episode or is this a condition.”,"right"
Pelosi said she had not spoken with Biden since the debate, but she emphasized that the president is on “top of his game, in terms of knowing the issues and what is at stake.”,"right"
It all amounts to a stunning and swift turn of events for Biden, his campaign and his allies on Capitol Hill, who have spent the better part of the last several years combating criticism about the president's fitness and defending his ability to serve another four-year term, at the end of which he would be 86 years old.,"right"
But Biden's shaky performance during the debate with Trump has shaken Democratic support to its foundations, with members of the party at all levels entertaining the possibility that he can no longer be the nominee.,"right"
Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee and an influential voice in the caucus, over the weekend broached the possibility of Biden stepping aside ahead of the Democratic convention in August.,"right"
“So whether he’s the candidate or someone else is the candidate, he is going to be the keynote speaker at our convention,” Raskin told MSNBC about Biden.,"right"
Other elected Democrats said they were caught off guard by Biden's rambling and raspy performance.,"right"
Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island, said that he has known Biden for years and served in the Senate with him but had “never seen that happen before.”,"right"
President Joe Biden ran up his numbers in Bucks County, which includes both cities, on the way to flipping Pennsylvania from Republican Donald Trump four years ago, and won among suburban women in the state by a substantial margin.,"right"
Biden and his allies are trying to replicate Democrats' success with suburban women this year and signaling they can win a small number of Republican women who may be opposed to a second Trump presidency.,"right"
About a dozen volunteers gathered in Biden's Bucks County campaign office on a recent sunny Saturday afternoon.,"right"
In addition to the Biden campaign’s outreach in politically mixed and Republican-voting neighborhoods of Bucks County, conservative groups such as Women4Us and Republican Voters Against Trump are mobilizing in suburban Philadelphia with hopes of peeling off GOP voters.,"right"
“President Trump is speaking to women when he discusses the sky-high cost of rent, groceries and gas in Biden’s America,” Trump’s national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.,"right"
About 6 in 10 suburban women in Pennsylvania voted for Biden in 2020, according to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of voters nationwide, while 4 in 10 voted for Trump.,"right"
About half of those who identify as Democrats or lean toward the Democratic Party said the main reason they're not satisfied with Biden was related to his age or his mental and physical health.,"right"
Suburban women voters were generally much likelier to say that Biden respects women, compared to Trump.,"right"
About 7 in 10 suburban women voters said Biden respects women a lot or some, compared to only about 3 in 10 suburban women who said that about Trump.,"right"
Anusha Bela, working from a laptop in a coffee shop in Doylestown's bustling downtown, had been a more fervent Biden supporter early on, but became disappointed with what she viewed as his slow response to Israel’s violence in Gaza.,"right"
