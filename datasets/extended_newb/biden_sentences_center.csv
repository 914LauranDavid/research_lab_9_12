U.S. President Joe Biden warned the Israeli government against a further intensification of bloodshed in the Gaza Strip as worries grow over the humanitarian disaster in enclave.,center
"[We] cannot have another 30,000 more Palestinians dead," Biden said in an interview with MSNBC on Saturday.,center
Asked whether an invasion of Rafah, in the south of Gaza on the border with Egypt, was a red line, Biden replied in the affirmative: "It is a red line.",center
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is “hurting Israel more than helping Israel” in his approach to the war against Hamas in Gaza, Biden said.,center
Netanyahu that “he must pay more attention to the innocent lives being lost as a consequence of the actions taken,” Biden said.,center
The Biden administration said that it now wants to built a floating pier to help deliver large amounts of aid into Gaza.,center
Even as Biden warned Israel's government against further targeting of the civilian population in Gaza, he reiterated his general support.,center
Ever since Joe Biden won the U.S. presidency, the rhetoric from Europe’s leaders has been filled with anticipation of a new transatlantic dawn.,center
Biden, a dyed-in-the-wool transatlanticist, pushed all the right buttons, stroking the Continent’s bruised ego after four years of relentless abuse.,center
And Europe stands ready,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen declared on the occasion of Biden’s inauguration.,center
Given the opportunity in recent weeks to show the Biden administration it was serious about geostrategic collaboration, Europe opted instead to show Washington the finger.,center
In late December, for example, the EU, prodded by Germany, agreed to a landmark investment pact with China, ignoring objections from across the Atlantic and requests from the Biden camp to hold off until the new administration was in office.,center
Whether Europe’s decision to effectively de-couple from the U.S. foreign policy agenda before Biden’s administration has really even begun is born out of a desire to achieve the dream of “strategic autonomy,” concern that Donald Trump could return in four years, or some combination thereof may not matter in the end.,center
WASHINGTON — Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko denied Sunday that former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma Holdings, a gas company Biden’s son Hunter was a board member of.,center
“My absolutely clear answer: no, never,” Poroshenko told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria on “Fareed Zakaria GPS.” “But I also cannot accept that, neither President Obama nor President Biden — Vice President Biden, nor President Trump, nor Vice President Pence never press[ed] me.”,center
Poroshenko became president of Ukraine in 2014, the same year that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma, a gas company based in Kyiv.,center
At the time, Vice President Biden was working with the others in the Obama administration to help reform policy and root out corruption in Ukraine.,center
Hunter Biden served on the board until early 2019.,center
U.S. President Donald Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have claimed, without corroborating evidence, that when he was vice president, Joe Biden inappropriately pressured Ukraine to remove a prosecutor who had launched an investigation into Burisma in order to protect his son.,center
Trump was accused of abusing his power by urging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens to help his reelection.,center
A majority of voters said it was inappropriate for Hunter Biden to be employed at Burisma while his father was leading the effort on policy change in Ukraine, according to a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll from February.,center
Congressional Democrats supporting Biden’s presidential bid have pushed him to punch back harder against Trump’s accusations.,center
Beijing sends warning to US, after Biden promises to defend island in case of ‘unprecedented attack.’,center
China hit back at U.S. President Joe Biden, over a promise he made Sunday that the U.S. would defend self-governing Taiwan if Beijing was to launch an invasion.,center
China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Monday that Biden’s remarks “severely violate commitment the US made not to support Taiwan independence.”,center
“Would U.S. forces defend the island?” Biden was asked on U.S. television, in an interview published Sunday night.,center
The comment was Biden’s most unambiguous yet about U.S. policy toward Taiwan, which has long been governed by the Taiwan Relations Act and the doctrine of “strategic ambiguity” — the notion that the U.S. would remain purposely noncommittal about defending Taiwan.,center
Mao Ning said that China had lodged a formal complaint with the U.S. over Biden’s comments, saying Beijing was “strongly dissatisfied,” and adding that the remarks sent a “seriously erroneous signal to Taiwanese separatist independence forces.”,center
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said Tuesday he is not sure Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump “even understands” what NATO’s Article 5 commitment to collective defense means, AFP reported.,center
Biden, who is visiting the Latvian capital Riga, said the U.S. had “pledged our sacred honor” to fulfill the NATO requirement to treat an attack against one member country as an attack against all, Reuters reported.,center
Biden said Tuesday ahead of talks with the presidents of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, that there was overwhelming bipartisan commitment to NATO in the U.S.,center
Joe Biden is right to convene a summit of democracies at a time when autocracies are on the offensive against the free world.,center
In her op-ed “Biden’s ‘summit of democracies’ won’t work” (December 8), Shada Islam argues that interests and values often do not align across the free world.,center
President-Elect Biden opened the first Copenhagen Democracy Summit and co-founded our Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity to curb election meddling.,center
LONDON — Joe Biden inherits a formidable in-tray from Donald Trump — but on trade talks with Britain, plenty of work has already been done.,center
One former U.S. official familiar with plans to engage with the U.K. after Biden’s January inauguration said the new administration is expected to take a more gradual and cautious approach to trade overall when compared to the Trump regime.,center
On Thursday and Friday, U.S. President Joe Biden will gather leaders from over 100 countries to a virtual “Summit for Democracy.” He invited rule-of-law troublemaker Poland.,center
The guest list for Biden’s democracy summit has been a source of speculation since he first floated the idea on the campaign trail.,center
BERLIN — Joe Biden took office nearly four years ago on a mission to repair America’s relationship with Europe — and then Vladimir Putin swept in and did it for him.,center
Biden is due to arrive in Germany on Thursday night for a brief visit to both celebrate the new spirit of transatlantic solidarity and discuss what the West can do to hamper the Russian president’s progress in Ukraine.,center
For all the inevitable talk about the importance of the alliance between their two nations, Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have left the world with a frozen conflict in Ukraine.,center
That’s why Biden’s visit to Berlin promises to be more of a counseling session than a valediction.,center
Biden later reversed that decision.,center
In contrast to Trump, Biden bent over backwards — long before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine — to soothe German fears about Washington’s commitment to their security.,center
Just a few weeks after taking office in 2021, Biden participated in the Munich Security Conference, albeit virtually from the White House.,center
In the months that followed, Biden appointed a parade of Germany-friendly officials to key positions on the National Security Council and in the State Department.,center
In early 2022 Biden dispatched Amy Gutmann as his ambassador to Germany.,center
For official Germany, which had spent four years fretting about what special torment Trump might have in store for them next, the rhetoric from Biden and his surrogates was a welcome salve.,center
Against that backdrop, the relationship between Biden and Scholz, who took office just weeks before the Russian invasion in February 2022, was close from the get-go.,center
“Scholz and Biden’s strategy of boiling the frog slowly in Ukraine did not really work,” said Jana Puglierin, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.,center
If nothing else, Biden’s visit to Berlin — which was originally scheduled for earlier this month but was delayed due to a hurricane in the U.S. — will offer the two leaders time to reflect on what they should have done differently.,center
Yet Biden’s farewell trip has mostly generated yawns.,center
Scholz’s three-party coalition has been on the rocks for months, and he’s unlikely to serve another term as chancellor; he might even end up ‘doing a Biden’ before Germany’s 2025 election.,center
Meanwhile, Biden’s visit, instead of cementing his legacy in Europe, will likely be little more than a reminder of what might have been.,center
The Obama administration is sending Vice President Joe Biden to make peace with Turkey.,center
Biden’s office on Saturday confirmed reports out of Turkey that he would visit the country on August 24, roughly a month and a half after a failed coup attempt in the strategically located NATO ally.,center
Biden will likely attempt to smooth the escalating tensions between Washington and Ankara during his trip.,center
Huawei's problems in Western capitals around the world may deepen under U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who is expected to replace Donald Trump's combative diplomacy against the Chinese telecom giant with a more united international effort to keep Beijing from dominating the internet.,center
Insiders at Huawei cautiously welcomed Biden's victory in the Nov.,center
They also foresee Biden maintaining or even extending the Trump-driven pressure campaign that has crippled Huawei, strained the global telecom sector and dragged others from software giants to chipmakers into the fight.,center
Biden is likely to bring “less noise and more content,” said Viviane Reding, former European commissioner for justice who has emerged as a strong critic of Trump’s demands for bans on Huawei in Europe.,center
“I hope and expect the Biden administration will show genuine interest in working with allies to create alternatives.,center
That kind of coalition means Biden could succeed where Trump didn’t: In building a global coalition of democracies that could join forces politically and on industrial terms to counter China's rise on tech.,center
European officials are already working to set up structures to embrace the expected Biden approach.,center
While Biden has not detailed a specific Huawei strategy, he has said he will put global cooperation at the center of efforts to counter China’s tech offensive: "To win the competition for the future against China or anyone else, the United States must sharpen its innovative edge and unite the economic might of democracies around the world," Biden wrote in a piece outlining his foreign policy in Foreign Affairs in March.,center
“The most effective way to meet that challenge is to build a united front of U.S. allies and partners,” Biden wrote.,center
Tony Blinken, Biden’s choice for leading the State Department, told Reuters this summer that Biden would seek to use NATO to address Chinese threats to global security, which could include Huawei’s attempts at making 5G inroads in Europe.,center
Or, as Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Biden’s nominee for U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said last week: “America is back.,center
The global effect of Trump’s style, according to Pallone, was to “sow doubt and confusion among our partners and allies.” He expects a steadier approach under Biden, with many in Congress ready to partner with the new administration, will be more effective.,center
If Biden wants to succeed in bringing back multilateral cooperation, he will have relationships to smooth out.,center
In Canada, government insiders anticipate a friendlier stance from Biden, who is politically close to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.,center
But several people inside the Trudeau government say they are not assuming that a Biden White House will make substantive changes in U.S. demands on Canada regarding Huawei.,center
Rob Strayer, a former State Department official who spearheaded Trump’s Huawei campaign and now works at tech industry association ITI, argued that “the coalition-building will be not all that different” under Biden.,center
But, he added that Biden’s focus would be on working through more formal structures like the G20, G7 or the World Trade Organization and include “the softer form of multilateralism of building a coalition of the like-minded.”,center
Biden “will understand these issues,” he added.,center
Biden has emphasized U.S.’ and allies’ strengths in research and innovation and his long-term plan to push back on — rather than indulge — protectionist tendencies.,center
Those measures are largely expected to remain in place once Biden is in office.,center
Steve Berry, who heads a trade group of U.S. rural wireless carriers known as the Competitive Carriers Association and discussed these issues with Biden transition team members last week, expects “no major change” in how the U.S. assesses the dangers of Chinese gear, he said.,center
Berry is seeking to secure more than $1.5 billion from U.S. lawmakers now for a subsidy program to help a few dozen rural carriers in the U.S. rid their networks of equipment from Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese telecom company network equipment, a bipartisan issue on Capitol Hill and one he stressed to Biden’s team.,center
There are also a number of China hawks in the Senate who could push Biden’s cabinet nominees to take a strong stance on Huawei.,center
Senator Marco Rubio (R.-Fla.), a frequent Huawei critic, last week called Biden’s early cabinet picks “polite and orderly caretakers of America’s decline” in a tweet, adding “I have no interest in returning to the ‘normal’ that left us dependent on China.”,center
In the U.K., the position is unlikely to change under Biden, Martin said.,center
He said even if Biden were to roll back sanctions, the possibility that they could be reinstated would loom.,center
If Biden decides to exert less pressure on these countries, it could leave them more wiggle room with how severe they make their restrictions.,center
For Biden’s incoming administration, the challenge will be to build actual consensus in the West on how to handle China’s technological rise — without alienating foreign governments with a long list of tech-related issues they want the Biden administration to take on.,center
It’s a lot for Biden and allied countries to reconcile as they push back against Chinese technology giants like Huawei.,center
If most European leaders now desperately want a new man in the White House — someone who can bring sanity and dignity to the Oval Office and U.S. policies — working with Joe Biden won’t fix what’s ailing the relationship overnight.,center
And yet, there are still plenty of potential pitfalls that could come with a Biden presidency.,center
That won’t be the case anymore under Biden.,center
Biden — despite anti-China rhetoric during his campaign and cross-party support for taking a tough line on Beijing — is likely to be less confrontational and more willing to listen to the EU’s view of China as a systemic rival, competitor and partner.,center
That won’t be such a bad development: If Biden does succeed in his ambition to put “America back at the head of the table,” a strong and self-confident Europe with its own networks of power and influence can be a real partner for America — not just a pushover.,center
The comments come after it was widely reported that U.S. President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range missiles, also known as the Army Tactical Missile System or ATACMS, for strikes on Russian territory.,center
The move marks a major shift in U.S. policy after the Biden administration’s long-standing refusal to agree to Ukraine’s request for authorization to use the missiles to hit targets outside its own borders.,center
Biden’s approval came in response to Russia’s use of North Korean troops in the war, The New York Times reported.,center
However, Biden’s decision to allow strikes into Russia “will not change” the balance of power on the battlefield, a high-level French military official told reporters Monday.,center
Joe Biden’s decision to pull U.S. forces out of Afghanistan by September 11 this year gave NATO allies their marching orders — they had little choice but to salute smartly and declare their troops will follow suit.,center
Some officials from the NATO countries most involved in Afghanistan said they appreciated the consultation undertaken by the Biden administration, which contrasted sharply with the rough treatment they suffered under Donald Trump.,center
Biden sent his secretaries of state and defense to Brussels this week to discuss the move and they stood shoulder to shoulder with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg to announce it.,center
Biden made clear the U.S. and its allies will be gone by September, come what may.,center
“President Biden made clear on the campaign trail that he intended to withdraw from the so-called ‘forever war,’ and so this decision was a question of when, not if,” said Joyce Anelay, a former minister in the U.K. Foreign Office who is chair of the House of Lords’ international relations committee.,center
Anelay said Biden’s final withdrawal date of September 11 was better that Trump’s planned deadline of May 1.,center
James Schwemlein, a former senior adviser to the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan at the U.S. Department of State, said the timeline made an orderly allied withdrawal “very possible.” Schwemlein, now an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, described Biden’s decision as “the best available bad option.”,center
U.S. President Joe Biden appointed Pressman envoy to Hungary in 2022.,center
Boris Johnson has work to do to woo Joe Biden should he become US president next week.,center
LONDON — If Joe Biden wins on Tuesday, corks will pop in many European capitals.,center
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has more ground to make up than most in the international race to be Biden’s No. 1 international ally, a station long-desired (and sometimes occupied) by British prime ministers.,center
The prime minister's association with Brexit — which Biden strongly opposed — his warm words for Donald Trump, and his past comments about some of Biden’s closest political allies don’t position him well.,center
The opposition Labour Party’s Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy told POLITICO that Johnson and his government had “needlessly and repeatedly created tension with the Democrats” — her words a sign that Labour spies a potential weak spot should Biden win, and Johnson fail to strike up a good partnership with him.,center
More positively, the U.K. — about to become G7 president, due to hold the UN Security Council presidency in February and hosting the COP26 climate conference in December 2021 — will have ample opportunities in the first 12 months of a Biden administration to demonstrate that, despite Brexit, its broader foreign policy goals fit hand in glove with Biden’s own.,center
U.K. officials have struggled, like all diplomats, to gain access to Biden’s inner circle (the Democrat's campaign has observed strict rules over meeting foreign officials to avoid any suggestion of outside influence following the scandal over Russian interference to boost Trump last time around).,center
But they remain confident that longstanding ties with Democrats on Capitol Hill, not to mention a dormant Democratic foreign policy establishment currently plying their trade at think tanks and in academia, will help them persuade an incoming Biden administration that there remains more to Britain than Brexit.,center
Here's how Johnson's administration might assess some of the key challenges it faces building bridges with a Biden White House:,center
U.K. officials deny the government’s Brexit priorities — and the identity of the prime minister — have left British diplomats scrambling to get to know Team Biden.,center
But officials also acknowledge privately what observers outside government state plainly: Biden deeply regrets the U.K.’s exit from the EU — and he might not immediately warm to Johnson either.,center
"The Biden team will not have forgotten the rudeness shown by Boris Johnson towards Obama and Hillary Clinton,” said Peter Westmacott, the U.K.’s ambassador to the U.S. from 2012 to 2016.,center
However, he said, while the two international agendas won't align on everything, Biden may see Johnson as a "natural ally" on several fronts.,center
“The personal relationship between Biden and Johnson will be the difficult one,” said former U.K Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind.,center
“Biden will be a bit stiff to start off with.,center
Biden is deep, deep Irish-American and therefore a bit untrusting of any British politicians with a track record on Ireland; and Johnson unfortunately has created a track record.”,center
“Biden, whatever doubts he has about Johnson personally, is long in the tooth,” Rifkind said, and like those predecessors would recognize that despite not seeing eye to eye on everything, the U.K. is a unique friend to have in Europe.,center
Biden knows all that.”,center
Douglas Lute, a retired U.S. army general who served as ambassador to NATO under Obama from 2013 to 2017, agreed that common interests and military and intelligence ties should not be underestimated when rating the strength of the U.S.-U.K. relationship under a potential Biden administration.,center
Biden would want to “refresh” U.S. relations with allies but also “ask more” of them, Lute predicted, “including a renewed emphasis on democratic values and the reimagining of national security to include such challenges as pandemics, climate and cyber.”,center
The U.K., as one of only 10 NATO countries spending the target 2 percent of GDP on defense, is likely to be in Biden’s good books on that score, believes Kim Darroch, U.K ambassador to the U.S. from 2016 to 2019.,center
He told Spectator TV earlier this month that “repairing the damage to NATO” would be one of Biden’s top two European priorities, alongside repairing relations with the EU.,center
“A Biden administration will expect the U.K. to sustain this defense commitment while also playing a leading political role in redefining security to account for new challenges,” he said.,center
In one respect, the U.K. has been dealt a good hand in 2021 if it wants to show willing and support Biden’s professed foreign policy goals of renewing alliances between democracies, strengthening international institutions within the UN and taking action on climate change.,center
London holds the rotating presidency of the G7 next year, and British officials see an opportunity to align Johnson’s embryonic idea of a expanded “D10” group of democratic allies — G7 nations plus three others, potentially India, South Korea and Australia — with Biden’s plan for a “summit for democracy” early in his term.,center
Meanwhile, the U.K. holds the rotating presidency of the United Nations Security Council in February, which would be Biden’s first full month in office.,center
Biden, who has vowed to restore U.S. leadership in international health and aid, will — British officials hope — see the U.K. as a useful lieutenant in such efforts.,center
With Biden vowing to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on his first day in office and to put the U.S. on the road to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, some spy an opportunity for Johnson to play his right-hand man in drumming up ambitious carbon-cutting pledges from countries around the world.,center
“It’s one of the few areas where the U.K. has global influence that the U.S. [under Biden] would want to align with,” said Nick Mabey, CEO of the E3G climate think-tank.,center
“Biden has already set out a very ambitious agenda on climate both at home and abroad and would obviously galvanise the international system,” said one U.K. official.,center
The key concern for London is not so much that Biden won’t want to do a trade agreement, it’s whether he’ll devote sufficient time and political impetus to the process to wrap it up before a looming deadline.,center
“Generally, it’s questionable whether Biden will be as focussed on trade policy or trade deals as Trump has been," said Stephen Booth, head of the Policy Exchange think tank’s Britain in the World project and author of a report on the U.S. deal.,center
"It’s fair to say that Biden is unlikely to attach the same importance or urgency to a U.K. deal as Trump.,center
Biden might also make more of repairing the U.S.'s political relationship with the EU in the first instance.”,center
Should negotiations continue in earnest — and, should he win, U.K. officials will be closely watching to see how quickly Biden appoints a trade representative (which often takes time) — the main sticking points, namely around U.S. food exports, will be the same, Booth expects.,center
Some U.K. officials anticipate a Biden administration will also place greater emphasis on labor and environmental protections, but are confident this won’t prove a stumbling block.,center
In the longer-term, Booth said, there is a chance Biden will embrace the idea of rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, something which the U.K. is also keen to join in its current revised form and renamed the “Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership” (CPTPP.) “This would present another route to a U.K.-U.S. trade deal,” Booth said.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden closed his first virtual summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping with a focus on economic competition, human rights and strategic risks including Taiwan.,center
While Xi called on America to stop suppressing Chinese businesses on the ground of national security, Biden shed light on Beijing's "unfair trade and economic practices" and the U.S. policy to work with allies to "stand up for its interests and values.",center
"President Biden also underscored the importance of managing strategic risks.,center
"On Taiwan, President Biden underscored that the United States remains committed to the 'one China' policy," the statement said, adding that the U.S. "strongly opposes" unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.,center
“There should be less blaming but more cooperation,” he told Biden.,center
Biden declared in the opening minutes of their long-anticipated meeting that the two leaders “have a responsibility for the world as well as for our people” to ensure that bilateral competition “does not veer into conflict, whether intended or unintended.”,center
Biden touted his decadelong history of lengthy one-on-one encounters with Xi and said they had “always communicated with one another very honestly and candidly“ and that they “never walk away wondering what the other man is thinking.”,center
“All countries have to play by the same rules of the road [and that’s] why the United States is always going to stand up for our interests and values, and those of our allies and partners,” Biden told Xi. “If past is prologue, I am sure that today we'll be discussing those areas where we have concerns — on human rights, on economics [and] to ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific.”,center
Those items are part of what Biden referred to as an “expansive and substantive” meeting agenda.,center
With Biden were Cabinet members, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and national security adviser Jake Sullivan.,center
Biden and Xi, who were speaking for the third time this year, communicated via interpreters in an encounter that a senior administration official said Sunday would “run several hours.”,center
Biden was seeking “a steady state of affairs between our two countries where we compete vigorously, where we push back on the many areas of concern we have with the PRC, and where we coordinate on issues where our interests align,” a senior administration official told reporters Sunday.,center
Biden is basing his latest engagement with Xi on a recognition that previous U.S. efforts to steer changes to the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic domestic policies and expansionist foreign policy have failed.,center
“Unlike previous approaches, with respect to China, the Biden administration is not trying to change China through bilateral engagement [because] we don't think that's realistic,” the administration official said.,center
But the timing of the leaders’ meeting, hours after Biden signed into law a $1 trillion infrastructure package, means “Biden is coming into the meeting with a strong hand as well,” said the official.,center
“President Xi will have a candid, in-depth and full exchange of views with President Biden on strategic issues shaping the future of China-U.S. relations ...,center
The senior administration official said Biden would also raise transnational “alignment” between the two countries, including on health security and action to address the climate crisis.,center
But Biden will reject any attempt by Xi to link China’s cooperation on climate to progress on specific bilateral issues.,center
Biden’s concerns about possible miscalculations that could lead to unintended U.S.-China military conflict puts the issue of “guardrails,” hinged to improved bilateral communications, on the agenda.,center
Elon Musk is stoking controversy on a new front, this time revealing sensitive internal deliberations at Twitter around Hunter Biden’s personal computer files in the fall of 2020.,center
The internal company discussions, which predate Musk’s ownership, offer insight on the dissent and confusion inside Twitter as it responded to the New York Post’s reporting on Hunter Biden’s files in the closing weeks of the last presidential campaign.,center
Hunter Biden’s leaked computer files — which shed light on his chaotic personal life and overseas business dealing — as well as Twitter’s handling of the leak have been the subjects of ongoing controversy for the past two years.,center
At a debate following the Post’s initial publication, then-candidate Joe Biden called the reporting a “Russian plant,” citing a letter by former intelligence officials saying the disclosure “has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.”,center
In a post-campaign interview with ABC News, Hunter Biden said he did not know whether equipment was his, but that it “certainly” could have been.,center
In March, the New York Times reported that emails from the cache related to Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings had been authenticated by people familiar with them.,center
Hunter Biden remains the subject of a Justice Department criminal investigation that has focused on his tax affairs.,center
House Republicans, who tweeted an homage to Musk in October, are planning to investigate Hunter Biden’s business dealings when they take over the chamber next month.,center
The alleged arrangements would be some of the closest known links between a Biden relative and a foreign government.,center
Jim Biden played a major role in a company called Americore, which the government has accused of massive Medicare fraud.,center
Joe Biden's U.S. election victory has triggered renewed debate across the Atlantic over Europe's role on the world stage.,center
Biden's victory might be expected to put wind in their sails, given he has championed international cooperation and pledged to restore close ties with America's traditional allies.,center
But champions of strategic autonomy have warned against thinking that Biden's win means the Continent can go back to an era of relying on Uncle Sam.,center
In her first reaction to Biden's win, the chancellor described transatlantic friendship as "indispensable if we are to deal with the major challenges of our time." In later remarks, Merkel stressed repeatedly that the U.S. and Germany, as part of the European Union, must stand "side by side.",center
When it comes to defense spending, only France among the EU's big economies meets the NATO target of 2 percent of GDP — a long-time demand of the U.S., which Biden is likely to maintain albeit in less incendiary tones than Trump.,center
Joe Biden on Saturday referred to President Donald Trump as a “clown” after a supporter asked the former vice president whether he would return Trump’s insults.,center
Biden, who is on the first swing of his 2020 campaign, told about two dozen supporters at a private fundraiser that he doesn’t want to get down in the mud with Trump.,center
“There’s so many nicknames I’m inclined to give this guy,” Biden said to laughter in the room.,center
Since launching his bid in late April, Trump has given Biden special attention, including referring to him as “Sleepy Joe.”,center
Biden said that while he plans to respond to Trump if directly attacked, he believes it is part of the president’s strategy to keep dialogue away from the issues.,center
“On every single issue and on every demeaning thing he says about other people, I have no problem responding directly,” Biden said.,center
Saturday marked the first of Biden’s two-day swing through South Carolina as part of a larger cross-country tour that will eventually bring him back to a rally in Philadelphia.,center
Biden spoke at a fundraiser in the private home of state Senator Dick Harpootlian, an attorney and former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman.,center
Earlier in the day, Biden spoke at a rally in Columbia before heading to the private fundraiser where he delivered remarks and took questions from supporters for about 20 minutes.,center
Biden’s campaign is allowing limited media access to all of the candidate’s fundraisers.,center
Biden highlighted his foreign policy background as he made the case for running.,center
Just then, Biden flubbed on his foreign leaders.,center
“One I can say is Margaret Thatcher, um, excuse me, Margaret Thatcher — Freudian slip,” Biden said to laughter in the room.,center
Biden also told the group he regrets once saying if he were in high school he would have taken Trump around back and “beat the hell out of him.”,center
I probably shouldn’t have done that,” Biden said Saturday, “I don’t want to get it down to that level.,center
Biden alluded to having private conversations with Trump, adding: “I let him understand what I think about him.”,center
“This guy is going to go after me and my family,” Biden said.,center
Biden then told a story about his grandchildren playing a role in urging him to run for president.,center
“‘Pop, you have to run Pop,” Biden said one of his grandsons, “Little Hunter” told him, then said his grandson showed him a photo online from Beau Biden’s funeral.,center
“‘Pop, it says: ‘Look at Biden molesting a kid,’” Biden said his grandson told him.,center
“Mommy and Daddy had a divorce and they’re going to really go after that,” Biden continued, in retelling what he said his grandchildren said to him.,center
Russian president also dismissed criticism of Joe Biden’s mental fitness.,center
Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday Joe Biden would be better for Russia as president than Donald Trump, ahead of a potential rematch between the two in this year’s U.S. election.,center
“[Biden] is a more experienced, predictable person.,center
Putin used Wednesday’s interview to downplay speculation about Biden’s cognitive health, recalling when the two met in Switzerland in June 2021, less than a year before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.,center
“When I met with Biden in Switzerland — it was, indeed, a few years ago, three years — even then there were talks about him being incompetent.,center
Trump, and Biden’s other Republican opponents, have seized on the president’s mental abilities to argue he isn’t fit to continue to hold office after a series of gaffes confusing world leaders and a recent Justice Department special counsel report that described him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”,center
Trump himself has faced questions about his age and mental acuity, with Biden’s campaign suggesting the former president may be struggling with diminished cognition and frequently calling him “confused.”,center
When former U.S. vice president Joe Biden attended the annual Munich Security Conference last month, the wonky foreign policy confab promised an escape from the nonstop speculation back home about the former vice president’s political plans.,center
Instead, Biden’s potential 2020 intentions to run for U.S. president were the talk of the conference.,center
When Armenian President Armen Sarkissian ran into him in a hallway, a TV camera captured him asking Biden: “Are you going to run?” (Biden whispered an inaudible answer.),center
And in several conversations with European leaders in Munich, Biden heard a repeated refrain, according to a conference attendee familiar with the conversations: The world needs you.,center
Citing Biden’s long foreign policy track record and longtime commitment to the transatlantic alliance, some of the leaders — echoing views from across the Continent — told Biden that his return to the White House would be a sure way to restore Western alliances that President Donald Trump has dramatically fractured.,center
Biden is now widely viewed as likely to announce a 2020 bid in the coming weeks.,center
While Biden was already likely to enter the race even without the encouragement of foreign leaders, one Democratic Party official close to Biden’s circle said that their support had fueled his appetite to run.,center
These nudges from abroad are a reminder of the heavyweight foreign policy credentials Biden would bring to a Democratic field in which they are currently in short supply.,center
None of Biden’s prospective rivals have the global experience or relationships with foreign leaders that Biden enjoys.,center
A former U.S. Senate foreign relations committee chairman, Biden has specialized in foreign policy for decades — a key reason why former U.S. President Barack Obama, who had modest credentials of his own in that realm as a freshman senator, tapped Biden to be his 2008 running mate.,center
As vice president, Biden was Obama’s ever-present adviser on world affairs and played a leading role in their adminstration’s Iraq and Ukraine policies.,center
Even some prominent conservatives concede that Biden would bring to the campaign a formidable depth of knowledge of global events, especially compared to his would-be Democratic rivals.,center

“If you look at this field, Biden is a giant in terms of his actual foreign policy experience.,center
Biden’s long record also brings vulnerabilities.,center
Former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who served in the first two and a half years of the Obama administration alongside Biden, wrote in his memoir that the vice president had been wrong on “nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.”,center
Biden’s primary rivals might attack him for his support of former U.S. President George W.,center
And Trump might savage Biden’s risk-averse counsel when Obama was weighing the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden.,center
Still, Biden’s supporters say his national security credentials will be a major net plus — especially in a field dominated by candidates more versed in the Green New Deal than the Iran nuclear deal.,center
“He’s been doing this for 30-plus years and even the best foreign policy hands end up being tutored by Joe Biden,” said one former foreign policy adviser to Biden who declined to speak on the record until that person’s former boss makes a decision about 2020.,center
Biden is a known quantity for many foreign leaders and other diplomats who have many years of experience dealing with him.,center
Doubts about where the Democratic candidates stand may have fueled the love for Biden on display in Munich last month.,center
Biden is a known quantity for many foreign leaders and other diplomats who have many years of experience dealing with him and his foreign policy advisers.,center

“There is little doubt that his name has a favorable ring in European ears,” former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, who was foreign minister when Biden was vice president, told POLITICO.,center
Anders Fogh Rasmussen, a former prime minister of Denmark and NATO secretary-general in the Obama years, has also told Biden that he hopes he will run for president on a platform of strong U.S. leadership and transatlantic harmony, said a person close to Rasmussen.,center
“Joe Biden is a good friend and I always enjoy our work together — but he knows his own mind and does not need my advice on whether he should run for President,” Rasmussen told POLITICO by email.,center
At the Munich conference, Biden gave a full-throated defense of U.S. engagement abroad.,center
Biden’s speech on the main stage at the Munich Security Conference “raised a lot of eyebrows” that he would be given such prominent space in the program.,center
Don’t have any doubt about that,” Biden told the crowd, which capped his speech with a standing ovation.,center
Biden’s speech on the main stage “raised a lot of eyebrows” that he would be given such prominent space in the program, according to another attendee of the conference.,center
At the conference, Biden met privately with the leaders of Ukraine, Greece, Kosovo and North Macedonia.,center
A conference attendee with knowledge of the matter said some of those leaders urged Biden to run.,center
Biden spokesman Bill Russo declined to comment on the content of his discussions with foreign leaders.,center
Foreign leaders view Biden “as a safe and consistent pair of hands on foreign policy and that’s what they’re looking for,” said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, who also attended the Munich conference.,center

Nicholas Burns, a former undersecretary of state in the Bush administration who introduced Biden before his speech in Munich and interviewed him on stage, noted that “Biden is deeply respected by European leaders and respected not just for the many and many decades of service but for the quality of it.”,center
After all of Trump’s broadsides against Europe and the world, former Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacio told POLITICO that “the thought of a Biden candidacy and presidency is reassuring.,center
Echoing some recent Republican arguments about judicial nominations, Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday suggested that President Barack Obama will not nominate a staunch liberal to replace Justice Antonin Scalia at a time when the ideological balance of the Supreme Court is up in the air.,center
In the wide-ranging interview that often turned provocative, especially when he complained about the Democratic presidential race he decided to skip, the vice president flatly said an Obama nominee in the outspoken progressive mold of former Justice William Brennan is “not going to happen.” Biden, who fiercely defended legislative prerogatives as the longtime chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also volunteered that “it was never intended for the president to pick whoever he wants and that’s it.” And he suggested the Senate has the right to consider not only a nominee’s philosophy, but how much the nomination would change the court, a common GOP talking point these days.,center
“This is a potentially gigantic game-changer,” Biden told a POLITICO reporter and a Washington Post reporter during a sitdown on Air Force Two.,center
Biden mentioned two examples of Republican nominees who were confirmed in times of flux because they weren’t overtly ideological conservatives — current swing Justice Anthony Kennedy, “who wasn’t a conservative’s conservative,” and former Justice David Souter, who often ended up voting with the Court’s liberal wing.,center
Biden said he hasn’t met with Obama to discuss the nomination yet, and he refused to discuss specific candidates like D.C. Circuit Judge Sri Srinivasan, who was unanimously confirmed by the Senate in 2013.,center
“There are a whole hell of a lot of people who Republicans have already voted for who fall into that category, and also people they haven’t voted for yet,” said Biden, who noted that he has presided over more judicial nominations than anyone in history other than the late Senator James Eastland of Mississippi.,center
Biden covered a variety of other topics in the 40-minute interview.,center
“In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king,” Biden quipped.,center
“Look, this is totally, thoroughly objective: We are so much better positioned than anyone else in the world, for Christ’s sake,” Biden said.,center
Biden agreed with the premise that the middle class is still hurting, but he said that it’s a big mistake for Democrats to accept the GOP notion that the country is in shambles, even though most Americans currently say the nation is on the wrong track.,center
Biden was clearly enjoying himself in his role as elder statesman, even if he did seem a bit wistful about missing out on what could have been his last campaign.,center
“My generic point is, you get behind the curve,” Biden said.,center
Clinton and Sanders have both sung the praises of Obama while dispensing gloom about stagnant wages and a rigged political system, but Biden said he wishes they would spend more time “pushing back on the story line that what we did to get us to this point was a failure and a mistake.” When asked why he thinks they sound so gloomy, he acknowledged that his was a minority view among pundits, and noted, without much apparent conviction, that Clinton and Sanders are both surrounded by “a lot of smart people who are probably politically smarter than me.”,center
Biden did say, without much enthusiasm, that he could support either Clinton or Sanders, and he probably revealed some lingering tensions with Clinton when he went to great lengths to defend Sanders against the notion that he’s another out-of-the-mainstream McGovern.,center
Biden said that on many key issues, Clinton and her socialist rival are “basically on the same page, with different emphasis,” and that the Sanders focus on vast inequality and campaign-finance corruption resonates with nonleftists.,center
“Look, what Bernie is talking about now is mainstream,” Biden said.,center
I haven’t heard him lay out in detail what the socialist part of his agenda is.“ When asked whether a single-payer health care system counted, Biden again came to Sanders’ defense.,center
Biden was clearly enjoying himself in his role as elder statesman, even if he did seem a bit wistful about missing out on what could have been his last campaign.,center
The Biden White House made a splash with its two-day virtual summit, but there are thorny issues to address before the world makes major progress.,center
Joe Biden’s election as president of the United States triggered a burst of enthusiasm in Europe for a new dawn in transatlantic relations.,center
As Biden prepares to take office, Europeans have been hoping he can deliver solutions to an ongoing dispute on digital tax, address their concerns about privacy and surveillance and come up with common ways to regulate social media.,center
Biden’s team has insisted that it will work with allies to develop common standards on technology and human rights — but only insofar as they fit into a broader strategy of countering what they see as China’s unfair market practices and human rights abuses.,center
Biden has said he would re-enter the Paris accord, and the U.S. has withheld imposing tariffs in retaliation against France’s digital tax.,center
Meanwhile, major antitrust lawsuits targeting Big Tech are moving ahead in multiple states, and Biden has voiced interest in improving privacy protections in the United States.,center
Biden has made clear that, while he won’t pursue Trump’s policy toward Beijing, the country will remain a crucial focus of his foreign policy agenda.,center
Given those objectives, which Biden’s incoming National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan hinted at shortly before the deal was signed, the China deal is damaging transatlantic relations at a time when repair work is badly needed.,center
Soon after Biden’s win, the EU’s top trade negotiator Sabine Weyand pitched a new “Trade and Technology Council,” in which Washington and Brussels could hash out differences on matters ranging from the digital tax to privacy and online regulation.,center
And on Sunday, EU industry chief Breton doubled down, calling in an op-ed for Europe and the Biden administration to “join forces, as allies of the free world, to start a constructive dialogue leading to globally coherent principles” for regulating the web.,center
Meanwhile, a European Commission official said that members of the Biden entourage are already in touch with counterparts in Brussels to get the ball rolling on enhanced cooperation.,center
It’s not hard to see why Europeans are sounding so warm and fuzzy about the Biden team.,center
“Their view of the world is very similar to ours,” said German conservative Norbert Röttgen, who is a candidate to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel after the election in September, referring to the incoming Biden team.,center
EU champions of the China deal, whose contents have not been made public, argue that it has nothing to do with transatlantic relations, but that’s likely to be a hard sell to a Biden administration that has placed allied efforts on China at the top of its foreign policy playbook.,center
But even if the deal does get torpedoed by Parliament, Biden is likely to struggle to get Europe fully behind him when it comes to Beijing.,center
UPDATED: This article was updated to clarify that members of Biden's entourage were in touch with the Commission.,center
And that is leading some trade diplomats in Geneva to question whether the patient would survive the operation that Joe Biden’s administration has in mind.,center
Biden has held that course, reflecting bipartisan abhorrence in Washington at the WTO’s perceived overreach.,center
Biden subsequently suspended the tariffs, but Washington and Brussels are still in talks to lay the dispute to rest.,center
Whereas many are aiming for February 2024, when the WTO holds its 13th ministerial conference (aka MC13) in Abu Dhabi, the U.S. maintains that the pledge means December 2024.That would be a month after the next U.S. presidential election, in which the 80-year-old Biden has announced he will seek a second term.,center
KYIV – U.S. President Joe Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan made a surprise visit to Kyiv to “check the clocks” and assure Ukraine that it can still rely on the U.S. as a powerful ally.,center
President Biden is working on this on a daily basis to try to deliver this package through [the] house but I cannot make any specific predictions.",center
The last time Sullivan came to Kyiv was with Biden in February 2023.,center
We know that the Biden administration does everything possible for the so-necessary $60 billion aid bill to be adopted.,center
Biden came up with the $60 billion aid initiative for Ukraine in August, but it has since become stuck in Congress, tied to domestic border security funding, with Republicans refusing to move it through.,center
In 2023, only 10 percent of Ukrainians preferred Trump over current U.S. President Joe Biden, whereas 78 percent favored Biden over Trump.,center
Now, some 55 percent said they still trust Biden, the report, which surveyed 1,000 Ukrainians in mid- to late-November, notes.,center
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz together with Biden suffered the worst loss in credibility, dropping by 25 and 27 percentage points respectively.,center
Joe Biden might expect a little credit for not being Donald Trump, but when it comes to money for poor countries to fight climate change the world just wants the U.S. president to pick up his predecessor's tab.,center
Despite Biden’s promise that the U.S. is a reborn climate leader, veterans of international climate talks told POLITICO that U.S. frugality is one of the biggest impediments to success at November's COP26 climate summit.,center
The Biden administration said in April it would double U.S. annual climate finance giving to $5.6 billion.,center
“I can assure you that we are looking for ways to go even further toward meeting the collective goal of mobilizing $100 billion a year,” Biden said Friday of his previous commitment to double U.S. climate aid by 2024.,center
There were “very big expectations” that when Biden came to office he would pay his “arrears” to the fund, said Mohamed Nasr, an Egyptian diplomat who negotiates climate finance issues on behalf of the African group of nations.,center
Governments, chiefly the EU and the U.K., have been privately prodding the Biden administration to up the ante, said Jake Schmidt, senior strategic director of international climate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an NGO.,center
Later on the day of von der Leyen's speech, a senior Biden administration official was asked during a press call whether the U.S. planned to increase its climate finance pledge.,center
Kerry himself has been optimistic about the prospect of more money, and Biden told G7 leaders in June a “conjectural figure” he anticipated being able to announce before COP26.,center
Biden officials have noted Congress controls government spending.,center
“They want to do more, they’re looking to do more and given pressure from other countries it wouldn’t shock me if there was an announcement before COP26 relatively soon,” another person who had spoken with Kerry’s team said of the Biden administration’s climate finance ambitions.,center
Power was speaking at a press conference on the Armenia-Azerbaijan border, and said she had been sent by U.S. President Joe Biden on a fact-finding mission.,center
GENEVA — For the rest of the world, the Back-to-the-Future spectacle of Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin re-enacting Cold War diplomacy offered a clear silver lining: at least America and Russia are talking again, creating a glint of hope that the two presidents might actually be able to do business.,center
Biden called the discussion “good, positive.,center
Asked if he trusted Putin, Biden put a spin on one of Reagan’s best-known sayings.,center
But especially for EU allies counting on Biden to help them escape what European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called a “negative spiral” in relations with Russia, there will now need to be quite a bit of trust that the U.S. leader can forge a partnership with a man who confounded, and at times infuriated, four previous American presidents.,center
Biden said that the face-to-face meeting on Wednesday was a crucial start, and suggested he believed he could succeed where others had failed.,center
“I know we make foreign policy out to be some great skill somehow, it’s like a secret code,” Biden said.,center
In reference to Biden once saying he believed Putin was a killer, the Russian president raised the issue of civilian deaths from U.S. drone strikes in Afghanistan or Iraq.,center
But Biden, during his news own conference, made a clear, forceful presentation that appeared to represent the start of an effort to recognize Russia’s interests, while not compromising on Western values, and to erode Putin’s long-practiced victimization routine, in which he insists to his citizens that the U.S. and its allies are simply against Russia and will never change.,center
“I told President Putin my agenda is not against Russia or anyone else; it’s for the American people,” Biden said.,center
“I also told him that no president of the United States could keep faith with the American people if they did not speak out to defend our democratic values, to stand up for the universal rights and fundamental freedoms that all men and women have, in our view,” Biden said.,center
Biden’s approach was a stunning contrast to Donald Trump’s handling of a joint news conference after his own summit with Putin in Helsinki in 2018, where he allowed Putin to speak for him, and for the U.S., and where Trump effectively said he trusted Putin more than his own U.S. intelligence services.,center
Biden, by contrast, said he had informed Putin of 16 types of critical infrastructure that he said should be off-limits to cyberattacks, and other red lines such as zero tolerance for election meddling.,center
“The bottom line is, I told President Putin that we need to have some basic rules of the road that we can all abide by,” Biden said.,center
Biden, by contrast, took questions only from U.S. media outlets.,center
And Biden’s assertion that the U.S. does not ever meddle in elections drew snorts, given ample historic evidence that the U.S. has interceded in numerous elections, including in Latin America and the Middle East.,center
“I did what I came to do: Number one: identify areas of practical work our two countries can do to advance our mutual interests and also benefit the world,” Biden said.,center
Biden was a tad more optimistic.,center
In the U.S., some Republicans quickly accused Biden of not being tough enough, especially about Russia’s pattern of malign activity, and for not taking stronger steps, for example, to stop the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project.,center
But Samuel Charap, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, said that there was a chance Biden and Putin could build a new relationship and that expecting any contrition, let alone an apology, from Russia was unrealistic.,center
President Barack Obama endorsed Joe Biden’s White House bid on Tuesday, formally throwing his support behind his former vice president and the now-presumptive Democratic nominee.,center
And that’s why I’m so proud to endorse Joe Biden for president of the United States.”,center
Bernie Sanders also endorsed Biden’s candidacy.,center
Obama’s endorsement, while widely expected, also represents a new phase in the general election campaign against President Donald Trump, unlocking the Democratic Party’s most powerful surrogate for Biden at a time when his campaign has struggled to cultivate momentum amid the outbreak of the coronavirus in the U.S.,center
Although Biden maintained during the primary that he had asked Obama not to endorse any particular Democratic candidate — insisting that “whoever wins this nomination should win it on their own merits” — he relentlessly invoked his eight years of service under the former president and close personal relationship with him to court voters.,center
Biden’s efforts to align himself so closely with Obama, even as the previous administration’s policies came under occasional scrutiny from the party’s left flank, were ultimately successful in propelling him past more progressive rivals to become Democrats’ pick to challenge Trump in November.,center
His tenure as Obama’s No. 2 also contributed immeasurably to Biden’s firewall of support among African-American voters and proved foundational to the campaign’s argument that the former vice president was a capable, experienced leader ready to assume the responsibilities of the Oval Office.,center
Weighing in on the endorsement Tuesday, Brad Parscale, Trump’s reelection campaign manager, asserted that Obama “spent much of the last five years urging Joe Biden not to run for president out of fear that he would embarrass himself,” and now “has no other choice but to support him.”,center
“Obama was right in the first place: Biden is a bad candidate who will embarrass himself and his party,” Parscale said in a statement.,center
When Biden officially entered the race last April, the former president’s spokeswoman said Obama “relied on the vice president’s knowledge, insight and judgment throughout both campaigns and the entire presidency,” and added that the two men “forged a special bond over the last 10 years.”,center
The attorney general will be the latest member of Biden’s Cabinet to make a trip to the war-torn country.,center
Campaign representatives for both Joe Biden and President Donald Trump declined to answer questions on their plans for the EU.,center
Speaking to French media, he hinted that a Biden presidency could help to defuse mounting tensions over the tax.,center
Trump administration officials have been explicit that they will trigger tariffs if any country starts levying the tax, while experts argue that a Biden presidency would be unlikely to take a fundamentally different approach.,center
While Biden has said the U.S. should set privacy standards “not unlike the Europeans,” federal privacy legislation would take years to enact, if it is ever approved at all.,center
Both Biden and his pick for vice president, Kamala Harris, have been known for taking a friendlier stance toward Big Tech than their counterparts on the left of the Democratic Party.,center
That said, Harris has shown interest in addressing algorithmic bias and Biden's campaign promises to "ensure the technologies of the future like AI are bound by laws and ethics.”,center
It’s unclear exactly how Biden will address 5G security, or if he will pursue the Trump administration’s withering anti-Huawei "Clean Network" campaign.,center
But Biden himself has so far been discrete about his plans on Big Tech, with some saying Europe and the U.S. could come together on lower-hanging fruit: content moderation, for which Biden has advocated regulation, in line with what the EU is doing with the Digital Services Act.,center
Joe Biden wants to secure a political agreement with the European Union to restore confidence in data flowing across the Atlantic when he meets leaders in Brussels on June 15, according to five people with knowledge of the talks.,center
The deal that Biden is seeking — in the form of a high-level political agreement with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during the upcoming EU-U.S. summit — would lay the groundwork for a new transatlantic data transfer deal, according to the five people, who spoke to Digital Bridge, POLITICO's transatlantic tech newsletter, on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the talks.,center
Biden is expected to urge von der Leyen to back a political agreement around a new data transfer agreement, according to sources in both Washington and Brussels.,center
Underscoring how much Washington is putting on this diplomatic full-court press, Gina Raimondo, the U.S. commerce secretary, and Katherine Tai, the U.S. trade representative, are expected to join Biden during his visit to Brussels.,center
The upcoming trip marks the first time that Biden and von der Leyen will meet in person to hammer out thorny issues from combating climate change to rebuilding the global economy hit by the coronavirus pandemic.,center
Since taking office in January, Biden's administration has put forward suggestions to meet the EU's concerns over how the bloc's data is handled in the U.S., according to two individuals with knowledge of the matter who did not provide specifics on the recommendations.,center
After the White House proposed including data transfers in the upcoming EU-U.S. summit, two EU officials said they were surprised that the Biden administration was doubling down on the issue when both sides' negotiating teams remained far apart on how best to solve the outstanding issues linked to U.S. government surveillance.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have “in principle” agreed to hold a bilateral summit followed by a meeting with all relevant parties on the security situation in Europe, after both leaders spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday, the Elysée said.,center
Macron’s second call with Putin came after the French president spoke with Biden for around 15 minutes.,center
In its readout, the Elysée said Macron had proposed the summit between Biden and Putin, and then with all parties, “to discuss security and strategic stability in Europe,” with Biden and Putin having “both accepted the principle of such a summit.”,center
President Biden accepted in principle a meeting with President Putin following that engagement, again, if an invasion hasn’t happened.”,center
Vice President Joe Biden took a hard stand against Russian leader Vladimir Putin in a speech at the Brookings Institution Wednesday, saying the situation in Ukraine is a “humanitarian tragedy created by Russian aggression.”,center
Biden’s comments did not directly contradict those of Secretary of State John Kerry, who met with his Russian counterpart in Sochi earlier this month, but Biden did strike a tougher tone in dealing with the Russian government.,center
But Biden put the onus of Minsk almost entirely on Russia while praising Ukraine’s pro-western government.,center
“The United States sanctions on Russia must and will remain in place until the Minsk agreement is fully implemented,” Biden said, adding that there’s “no way to know that until the end of the year.” He also doubled down on America’s commitment to funding Ukrainian military equipment and basic training.,center
Biden also decried Russian corruption around the globe, saying that “Russia and others are using corruption and oligarchs as tools.”,center
Later in the speech, Biden said tension with Russia over the situation in Ukraine does not mean that the two countries should not cooperate on other global issues, like the nuclear negotiations with Iran and combating terrorism.,center
And as world democracies gather virtually at United States President Joe Biden’s Summit for Democracy this week, the invitees — including 26 member countries of the European Union — should view them as such.,center
Biden thus understandably opted for a wide tent approach to his list of participants: More than 100 countries will be present at the summit, several of which stand out as weak democracies or visibly display authoritarian traits.,center
Indeed, the latter two countries did not even make it onto Biden’s rather generous list of invitations.,center
Keir Starmer has denied that Joe Biden is senile or too old to be president of the United States.,center
Biden is under increasing pressure to withdraw from the November presidential election, following an often incoherent debate performance last month that put his mental acuity under the spotlight.,center
With presidential rival Donald Trump consistently leading in the polls, a growing number of Democratic Congress reps and even actor George Clooney, a major party fundraiser, have said Biden should withdraw from the race.,center
Asked during a sit-down interview with the BBC whether the president had appeared “senile” during their meeting, Starmer rejected the suggestion, saying Biden was “absolutely across the detail.”,center
It was the first time the U.K’s new prime minister, who was elected last week and is in Washington for the NATO summit, had met Biden.,center
Biden is emphatically resisting calls to withdraw from the presidential race and has framed such demands as a struggle between himself and Democratic party “elites,” in a number of interviews and speeches.,center
“I don’t care what those big names think,” Biden said during a Monday interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program, after the hosts listed some prominent Democrats who have called on him to step aside.,center
Perhaps the easiest way to limit the damage caused by Joe Biden is to play the music from classic TV comedy “Curb Your Enthusiasm” after every public pronouncement.,center
Biden, as you will by now be aware, mixed up Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin at the NATO summit (and let’s be clear, Biden could have mixed up Zelenskyy with anyone else in the world — Liz Truss, Darth Vader, the wolf that killed Ursula von der Leyen’s pet pony — and it would have been less embarrassing).,center
But if Biden had simply turned to camera, gave a knowing look, perhaps widened his eyes and arched his eyebrows before the “Curb” music kicked in, we might be talking about his comedy genius rather than wondering how on earth this man is going to stop Donald Trump — because if Trump is the lucid one, we’re all screwed.,center
And it’s another Italian who could be the person to save Biden and therefore the entire future of Western democracy, if that’s not hyperbole (which it definitely isn’t) … Giorgia Meloni.,center
We saw a classic of the genre this week at the NATO summit in which Meloni — waiting for, you’ve guessed it, Biden — gave a ludicrously exaggerated eye-roll before pretending to check a watch she wasn’t wearing.,center
So why don’t we simply combine the talents (and I use that word both advisedly and incorrectly) of Biden and Meloni and have her stand next to him during all public events?,center
But with the survival of the free world at stake, I ask you to bear with me: this way, when Biden confuses Kamala Harris and Donald Trump — as also happened at NATO — then she can immediately swoop in with a massive eye-roll and everyone will be too busy laughing to realize the awfulness of what’s going on.,center
If, for example, Meloni was about to further tighten immigration rules or appoint fans of the Mussolini family to her government, then Biden could cut through the tension by, say, mixing up Emmanuel Macron and François Mitterrand!,center
Just look at Joe Biden.,center
Biden, though loved by his party faithful, has the dubious distinction of having the lowest approval rating of any president at this stage of his term with the exception of Donald Trump.,center
Introducing the Biden Compatibility Index, a ranking of countries according to their affinity to the US president.,center
How close are Joe Biden and Europe, really?,center
While Biden’s election as U.S. president brought relief in (most) European capitals, it has done little to erode the distrust accumulated during the four years of Donald Trump’s presidency.,center
Introducing the Biden Compatibility Index.,center
Great move; you made Biden’s day.,center
And if you’re one of those countries that would have voted for Trump over Biden, don’t complain when the new guy gives you the stink eye.,center
Overall, Biden has plenty of reasons to be happy with how Europe is behaving.,center
And try as he might, Biden has had no luck convincing Germany to abandon the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will ship natural gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea.,center
The U.S.’s image in Europe has improved substantially after Biden’s inauguration — perhaps not surprisingly, considering his popularity on the Continent was high even prior to his election.,center
Whatever trust Biden may have regained, relations aren’t completely rosy.,center
Once described by Joe Biden as a Trump “clone,” Johnson gave a Munich Security Conference speech that positioned himself as the optimistic champion of the transatlantic alliance Donald Trump so often scorned.,center
In a speech clearly targeted at a Biden administration keen to rebuild ties with European allies, he sought to ease post-Brexit anxieties, insisting “our commitment to European security is unconditional and immoveable” and highlighted how the U.K.’s recent increase in defense spending would make the U.K. the second-biggest NATO contributor after the United States.,center
The U.K. prime minister, who as foreign secretary during the Trump era told U.S. diplomats of his belief that the president was indeed “making America great again,” struck a very different tone in one of his first major foreign policy speeches of the Biden era.,center
Speaking later at the security conference, which also heard from Biden, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, Johnson deployed another of his political trademarks: insatiable optimism.,center
The Biden campaign has been studying the ’18 midterms.,center
No, not the ones two years ago when Democrats took over the House by aggressively recruiting moderates and sweeping swing districts across the country, a precursor to Biden’s own centrist strategy in the Democratic presidential primaries this year.,center
“We went back and looked at voting in 1918,” said Anita Dunn, one of Biden’s top advisers, “where of course turnout was down, but the election was still held, and Congress was still seated.”,center
“Everything that’s happening right now is like nothing I’ve experienced in previous presidential campaigns.” — Anita Dunn, Joe Biden’s top adviser,center
The search for historical precedents by Biden’s top strategists to help understand the bizarre new reality of running a presidential campaign in a country gripped by a pandemic underscores how totally the politics of 2020 changed in March.,center
Biden’s Philadelphia headquarters has been cleared out.,center
“Everybody’s working remotely across the whole campaign,” said Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s communications director.,center
The presumed date by which Biden’s delegate nerds predicted Vermont Sen.,center
Biden had planned to use a predicted victory in Georgia on Tuesday to essentially end the race by declaring that he had achieved “an insurmountable delegate lead.”,center
Instead, the Georgia primary was moved to May and Biden retreated to a makeshift studio in his basement at home in Delaware to broadcast Zoom videos that have had to compete — poorly, so far — with briefings from elected officials like Trump and Gov.,center
With many remaining primaries getting kicked to May and June, Biden might not be able to deliver his “insurmountable delegate lead” line until the summer.,center
And while the pandemic has essentially erased Sanders from the news, there is an undercurrent of frustration — and a little nervousness — among some Biden aides that he has been robbed of a clean victory as the presumptive nominee at the end of March, as they had assumed he would.,center
“There’s no closure,” said a top Biden adviser.,center
The pandemic exploded and inserted itself as the only issue that matters just as Biden made his remarkable transition from lost cause to incredible comeback.,center
The rebound was so swift and his dominance over the race so sudden, that a lot of Biden advisers and outside allies are still processing what happened.,center
Did Biden build an excellent team that just took some time to get things right?,center
Or was Biden’s team hapless and he was simply the beneficiary of underlying dynamics in the primary that allowed him to beat Sanders?,center
“After Super Tuesday, Biden got catapulted to the front of the line in spite of himself and his campaign,” he said.,center
Biden clearly agreed that some version of this analysis was accurate: He replaced his campaign manager on March 12, after a string of victories made it clear he would be the nominee.,center
The Biden campaign has not quite figured out what will replace the traditional set piece events of a presidential campaign.,center
For now, in the teeth of the crisis, when attention is necessarily focused on the people in charge, Biden has two big problems.,center
former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden holds a virtual campaign event on March 13 in Chicago.,center
“Biden has a thin line,” the outside adviser to Biden said.,center
Then there’s the issue of Biden being denied one of his political strengths.,center
Biden thrives on personal connection; the pandemic has robbed him of the ability to meet with actual people.,center
But we talk about the day, and we hang out,” Biden told Jake Tapper on Tuesday.,center
“There are other Democrats who think all of the hand-wringing over Biden’s bizarre situation and the complexities and political downside of creating a virtual campaign are overblown.”,center
“We’re thinking through what does a virtual campaign look like, and how do we ensure that Biden is able to have that one-on-one connection that he is able to form with voters when he’s out in the real world,” said Bedingfield.,center
Next up, launching on Monday, is a regular podcast that Biden will host with a one-on-one conversation format.,center
Biden stumbled to victory with a nearly broke campaign.,center
Those twin developments have many Democrats concerned that Biden’s fundraising has dramatically stalled.,center
The Biden campaign acknowledged it was a serious concern.,center
“We are preparing for and thinking through how we execute the campaign knowing that it’s very possible that fundraising across the board, and not just for our campaign, it’s just gonna be leaner than it might have been a few months ago,” said a Biden adviser.,center
But there are other Democrats who think all of the hand-wringing over Biden’s bizarre situation and the complexities and political downside of creating a virtual campaign are overblown.,center
Across Europe, the congratulations for U.S. President-elect Joe Biden started flowing within minutes of the race being called, but it was clear that European leaders were also toasting themselves, the end of the Trump era, and the prospect of a renewal of transatlantic relations.,center
With President Donald Trump still claiming fraud and refusing to concede, many European leaders cast aside caution and diplomatic protocol to swiftly send their good wishes to Biden, the former vice president and longtime senator who is well known across the Continent.,center
“I want to congratulate the new President Elect of the USA Joe Biden,” Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin tweeted at 5:37 p.m. Central European Time, just 15 minutes after CNN became the first news network to project the Democratic nominee had finally won after four days of vote counting.,center
“Biden has been a true friend of this nation throughout his life and I look forward to working with him in the years ahead,” Martin wrote.,center
In a fuller statement, Martin noted Biden’s Irish family heritage.,center
“This is a particularly special day for the people of County Louth and of County Mayo who count President-elect Biden among their own,” he said.,center
But it was less the family connection and more Biden’s repeated statements in support of the Good Friday Agreement and, more broadly, U.S. Democrats’ backing of Ireland in the context of Brexit that gave Martin reasons to take the lead among Europeans wishing well to Biden, and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris.,center
“While some of the processes are still playing out, it is now clear Joe Biden has won,” Raab tweeted.,center
“Congratulations Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.,center
“I warmly congratulate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for their victory in the U.S. Presidential elections,” Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.,center
I look forward to working with President-elect Biden.”,center
On this basis the EU congratulates President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on reaching enough Electoral Votes.”,center
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who spent much of the past four years trying to keep Trump on board with the alliance, made clear he expected no such struggle with Biden.,center
“I warmly welcome the election of Joe Biden as the next President of the United States,” Stoltenberg said in a statement.,center
“I know Mr. Biden as a strong supporter of NATO and the transatlantic relationship.”,center
“Things will not just go back where they were.” Still, she pronounced herself as “feelin good” about Biden’s victory.,center
As his colleagues congratulated Biden, Janša noted that there was a still a court fight ahead, and that it was the mainstream media, not election officials, who had declared the winner.,center
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden is leaving his options open for 2020.,center
After presiding over the Senate Tuesday, where a cancer-treatment bill was renamed to honor his late son Beau, Biden spoke to reporters about his final days in the Senate before saying he was “going to run again.”,center
Biden was asked if he was kidding about running.,center
I learned a long time ago fate has a strange way of intervening,” Biden said.,center
Biden considered running for president this year, but decided against it after Beau died from cancer in May 2015.,center
European Council President Charles Michel will invite U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to participate in a videoconference with EU heads of state and government, perhaps even before the January 20 inauguration, a senior EU official said Tuesday.,center
Michel’s willingness to put aside formalities reflects just how thrilled most European leaders are about Biden’s victory and the prospect of renewing transatlantic relations, which frayed badly during the Trump years.,center
Biden has pledged to rejoin the Paris climate accords, reversing a Trump decision from early in his term that had left many EU leaders deeply distressed.,center
European leaders are also hoping that Biden will help renegotiate the Iran nuclear agreement, restore comity to trade relations, and generally reintroduce a level of civility in the discourse that has been absent in the years since Trump declared the EU a “foe” that had long taken advantage of the U.S.,center
On Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she looked forward to working with Biden and recalled good interactions with him when he served as vice president.,center
Word of Michel’s planned invitation came as Biden made an initial round of calls to European leaders.,center
More than a year after the controversial U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell resigned his post, the German news magazine Der Spiegel has reported that U.S. President Joe Biden plans to nominate Amy Gutmann, president of the University of Pennsylvania, for the role.,center
Still, she brings some experience in politics — she served as head of former President Barack Obama’s Bioethics Commission — and has come into frequent contact with Biden via his close ties to Penn.,center
While vice president under Obama, Biden kicked off his 2016 “Cancer Moonshot” program at Penn’s Abramson Cancer Center, and accepted an honorary professorship post at the university after leaving the White House in 2017.,center
Biden also helped found the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, D.C., in 2018.,center
Officials on both sides have been eager to repair relations since Biden took over, even as a handful of significant policy differences remain.,center
On a swing through Europe last month, the first international trip of his presidency, Biden underscored his commitment to U.S. re-engagement on the global stage.,center
Still, Biden’s presidency hasn’t returned things to their pre-Trump normal: Germany remains wary of relying on the U.S. as a long-term strategic partner, advocating for the European Union to take a more active role in charting its own future.,center
Nominating a well-established academic like Gutmann — particularly one who has extensive expertise on democracy issues — sends a signal that Biden is serious about his stated focus on shoring up democracies around the world.,center
At the same time, she added, “I think the Biden administration wants to know where Germany stands … This balancing act, which has happened for quite a long time now, is not sustainable.”,center
But Joe Biden’s brief visit to Northern Ireland across Tuesday night and Wednesday — 18 hours total, about half of them in bed — featured none of the gaffes that have previously blotted his diplomatic copybook.,center
Wednesday’s gathering at Ulster University in Belfast brought Northern Ireland’s opposing political leaders — including the key figure blocking the revival of power-sharing, Democratic Unionist chief Jeffrey Donaldson — side by side at last, along with a selfie-shooting Biden.,center
And instead of extolling his famous Irish Catholic roots, Biden’s speech noted the English and Protestant elements of his family tree, and the disproportionate contribution of Ulster Scots immigrants to the foundation of the United States.,center
“The family ties, the pride, those Ulster Scots immigrants who helped found and build my country, they run very deep,” Biden told the audience.,center
If Biden had punches to throw in the Democratic Unionists’ direction, he pulled them.,center
Speaking to POLITICO, a visibly relieved Donaldson said afterward that he’d appreciated the president’s “measured and balanced remarks” — and distanced himself from his unionist colleagues’ pointed criticisms of Biden as a poodle to Irish nationalism and even the outlawed IRA.,center
He also rebuffed a claim by his predecessor as DUP leader, Arlene Foster, that Biden “hates the United Kingdom,” stating: “The United Kingdom and the United States have a strong alliance and we want to build on that.”,center
He noted that Biden’s speech diplomatically avoided assigning blame for the Stormont impasse and focused on making a better Northern Ireland for today’s Ulster University students, who are too young to remember the three decades of bloodshed that ended following paramilitary cease-fires in the mid-1990s.,center
But Murphy added: “Biden’s pitch is about the future.,center
Most of those present agreed that, even though some leaders had wanted Biden to visit the Stormont parliament building overlooking Belfast, the president’s decision not to do so meant their failure to form a new government hadn’t become the central image of the visit.,center
The assembly’s caretaker speaker, Alex Maskey, also from Sinn Féin, agreed that in hindsight, Biden was probably right to have declined his own invitation to visit what is essentially Ground Zero of Northern Ireland’s political dysfunction.,center
While Biden strikingly spent less than a day in Belfast before crossing the border to spend the rest of the week touring the Republic of Ireland, he left behind his new envoy to Northern Ireland, Joe Kennedy III, who will spend the next 10 days building business and political contacts across the U.K. region.,center
Kennedy insisted Biden hadn’t needed to spend too much time in Belfast talking to local leaders this week — because he’d just had all of them, including Donaldson, as guests to the White House for St. Patrick’s Day.,center
Even by the shameless standard of attempting to claim every American president as Irish, Joe Biden’s April 2023 visit to Ireland was remarkable — not because of the U.S. president’s genuine affection for the land of his great-great-grandfather, but because the three-day agenda read more like a prolonged family bonding retreat than a serious attempt at forging deeper transatlantic ties.,center
In reality, Biden’s view of Ireland — mired in his ancestors’ escape from poverty, washed down with a heady dose of prose and poetry — represents an increasingly distant part of Irish-American folklore.,center
The issue here isn’t about diluting Ireland’s links to the U.S., or forgetting the importance of Irish America — as Biden well knows, shared history is a cultural centerpiece of identity.,center
It’s why Biden must be the last Irish-American president.,center
WASHINGTON — EU leaders in Washington for a summit with U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday had an important objective: projecting a united front after days of mixed messages on the Israel crisis.,center
European Council President Charles Michel, who is visiting the White House for the first time, will hold a bilateral meeting with Biden in the Oval Office ahead of the EU-U.S. summit.,center
Though Michel is formally charged with representing the EU on the global stage, it is von der Leyen who has the deeper relationship with the Biden administration, a link solidified during the run-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 when the Commission chief and her team worked closely with the White House on coordinating sanctions.,center
She has met Biden several times.,center
Michel previously took issue with von der Leyen’s stance on China, amid suspicions that the EU’s executive was overly swayed by the position of the Biden administration.,center
Biden is set to reverse Trump’s withdrawal from the WHO, but in the meantime, Europe has stepped up to the plate.,center
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rescind his country's planned withdrawal from the WHO on his first day in office, but his predecessor has left him a vastly changed political space.,center
Trump meanwhile, has refused to join COVAX and Biden's team is expected to hold talks with the alliance.,center
Biden has made clear his commitment to global health and the WHO, tweeting in July: “Americans are safer when America is engaged in strengthening global health.,center
His campaign website states that he will call for “fully resourcing the WHO, especially its Contingency Fund for Emergencies.” But in the four years that Biden has been out of the White House, much work on global health has been undone.,center
It’s expected that Biden will repeal the policy once he is in office — a move welcomed by many working in global health.,center
The financing of global health will be one of Biden’s first challenges, said Kickbusch.,center
Kickbusch said that it isn’t clear how Biden will address this, nor how he will go about future funding of the WHO.,center
A Biden presidency could pave the way for strengthened relations between the EU and the U.S., with global health issues set to continue to dominate the headlines for months to come.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden “absolutely” supports European allies developing their own, stronger military capabilities — but it’s high time for EU leaders to move beyond theory and rhetoric, State Department Counselor Derek Chollet told POLITICO on a visit to Brussels.,center
The push for increased European military prowess, often called “strategic autonomy,” got a boost from Biden this fall after his administration infuriated France by announcing a surprise Indo-Pacific security partnership with the U.K. and Australia.,center
As part of his effort to patch up relations with French President Emmanuel Macron, Biden agreed to support a raft of joint security and defense initiatives, which they discussed on the sidelines of the recent G20 summit in Rome and detailed in a joint statement.,center
His trip to the Bosnian capital coincided with the 26th anniversary of the Dayton signing, and Chollet said he carried a “pretty stern message” from the Biden administration, warning the country’s leaders against provocative language, including some suggesting a breakup of the country.,center
Chollet noted that numerous U.S. officials, including Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, had spent time earlier in their careers working to help bring peace to the former Yugoslavia.,center
But if Chollet is a veritable in-house scribe of State Department history, he noted the unhappy precedent of having so few of Biden’s ambassadors confirmed by the Senate, partly the result of a Republican blocking campaign, and fueled by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.,center
In the interview, Chollet described the backlog in ambassador confirmations as evidence of the larger political polarization and gridlock that has gripped the U.S. in recent years and worsened during the four years of Donald Trump’s presidency, which he said created “a lot of uncertainty and guessing about where the U.S. is headed.” Biden, he argued, has “tried to spend the first 10 months resetting a bit.”,center
Chollet said that Biden, like former President Barack Obama, was wrestling with an ever-more complicated, multipolar global system and trying to repair the damage at home and abroad: “Now, we’ve got the rise of China, we had a pandemic, and that we’re still struggling with, of course, and deeper domestic dysfunction in the United States.”,center
And Biden must give attention to that dysfunction, he said.,center
A split is emerging at the very top of the European Union over the bloc’s China policy, amid growing pressure from U.S. President Joe Biden for Brussels to take a more hawkish stance toward Beijing.,center
Senior figures in the European Council — including President Charles Michel — are pushing for a less confrontational approach to China than that of the Biden administration, which is trying to pressure allies to team up in taking on Beijing.,center
In particular, there is concern within the European Council about the joint statement issued by von der Leyen and Biden following their meeting in the White House last Friday.,center
But the U.S. has indicated that Biden won’t attend a summit in Europe before June — a sequence of events that will delay the next EU-China summit until the second half of the year.,center
Von der Leyen herself has struck up a strong professional relationship with Biden.,center
Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel was also reluctant to toe the line on U.S. policy regarding China — infuriating Sullivan and incoming members of the Biden administration during the transition period between the Trump and Biden presidencies, when she helped drive an EU trade pact with China in December 2020.,center
LONDON — If the first weeks of 2021 are anything to go by, the United States under Joe Biden will present a wholly different face to the world.,center
Still, Biden’s priorities are becoming clearer.,center
Biden is “very focused” on addressing climate change, he pointed out, “as is Boris Johnson” with Britain's hosting of the COP26 climate conference in November.,center
“The U.S., under President Biden, is likely to introduce a tariff regime that encourages sustainable trade,” said Rebecca Harding, chief executive of Coriolis Technologies.,center
And it is worth watching “what the Biden administration does on carbon border taxes,” said Tim Figures, a senior expert on geopolitics and trade at the Boston Consulting Group, late last year.,center
Such rifts could potentially dilute the West’s response, and Holmes said a top priority for Biden “will be the desire to mend fences with the EU and to find a better way to respond to China." Is there a way for the U.K. to play a diplomatic role in between?,center
On Wednesday Britain’s trade secretary Liz Truss clearly echoed Biden as she called for an alliance of free-trading democracies — including the United States and Japan — to protect global trading rules.,center
If the U.K. can turn its gaze from Brexit, Holmes said, “we will need to respond to the Biden trade agenda.” Trade agreements will be at the bottom of the new president's priorities, he added, and “a separate trade deal with the U.K. will be relatively unimportant.”,center
But Biden’s trade team led by U.S. Trade Representative nominee Katherine Tai will still need to get into position.,center
The U.K. is working to entice the Biden administration back to the table by promising to go further on the deal’s sustainability provisions.,center
Yet dealing with the domestic economic aftermath of COVID-19 and all the other burning issues left by the Trump administration will cause the deal to “fall down the political agenda,” said Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, shortly after Biden’s election.,center
In an early move, Biden and Tai may “roll back some of the Trump tariffs,” said Dan Griswold, a senior trade research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center, a free-market think tank.,center
Truss repeatedly raised the issue in U.K.-U.S. trade negotiations with Lighthizer — and Britain now looks to the Biden administration for the next move.,center
“We are so lucky to have the European Union as a partner in what we do,” U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who personally delivered the late-May Valentine on behalf of President Joe Biden, said Wednesday evening.,center
EU leaders, officials and diplomats are generally thrilled to have Biden in office instead of Donald Trump.,center
But some have complained that the U.S. is also back to its friendly exceptionalism, occasionally taking decisions with minimal or no consultation, such as Biden’s unexpected support for lifting patent protections for coronavirus vaccines.,center
But she also praised the quick action by Brussels and noted Biden had applauded it and intended to follow up with U.S. measures.,center
Liz Truss predicted Joe Biden will never do a trade deal with the United Kingdom.,center
Truss told the Heritage Foundation think tank in Washington D.C.: "There will not be a U.S.-U.K. trade deal under Joe Biden.,center
Speaking Monday, she contrasted Biden's attitude to a deal with his predecessor Donald Trump, who she's rowing in behind in November's U.S. presidential election.,center
Biden's administration shelved separated plans for a more limited, "foundational" trade agreement last December after Senate opposition and disagreements over the deal's scope.,center
European diplomats and officials have described their shock at President Joe Biden’s faltering, error-strewn public performances and revealed they have already started reaching out to Donald Trump.,center
With his poll numbers in decline, Biden is under mounting pressure from his own supporters to step aside in favor of a younger candidate like Vice President Kamala Harris to take on Trump at November’s presidential election.,center
First, there was Biden’s stumble at the presidential TV debate last month, in which he lost his train of thought, triggering a wave of soul-searching among Democrats and others who worry what a new Trump term will bring.,center
Then, on Thursday, came Biden’s long press conference at the close of the NATO summit in Washington, during which he insisted he was fit enough to serve another term and the best person to beat Trump.,center
When Biden introduced Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy as “President Putin,” there was an audible gasp among Europeans in the room.,center
Nobody mentioned it with the Biden team afterward.”,center
The Trump outreach has accelerated, another diplomat said, and predates Biden’s latest gaffes.,center
The NATO summit marked the first meeting of Biden and new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to reaffirm the so-called “special relationship” between the United Kingdom and the United States.,center
“It is now clear that Joe Biden sticking to his candidacy will only help Trump,” said Roderich Kiesewetter, a prominent Christian Democrat lawmaker on the Foreign Affairs Committee in Berlin.,center
“It can only be hoped that the Democrats will find a way for Joe Biden to withdraw while saving face and that Kamala Harris, for example, will become the Democrats’ frontrunner.”,center
But look closer, and it turns out that on everything from trade and taxes to coronavirus vaccines, U.S. President Joe Biden is transpiring to be every inch as much of a pain in Brussels' bureaucratic backside as his predecessor — hitting the EU exactly where it hurts, while robbing it of the moral high ground it loves to occupy.,center
Biden's bombshell proposal to waive intellectual property rights on coronavirus vaccines is a perfect case in point, as the EU is now floundering in the PR war, all too conscious that it has suddenly been turned into a cartoon villain, advocating the rights of Big Pharma against poor nations.,center
"The real change is that the Biden administration, to our biggest astonishment also including mine, is really changing the overall narrative on these issues, which we didn't think he would," said Kathleen Van Brempt, a Belgian member of the European Parliament and the Socialist group's point person on trade.,center
In only a few months, Biden has exposed both the folly in the EU's trade policy toward China and Europe's lack of ambition in plans to tax digital multinationals.,center
Infuriatingly for the Europeans, while the superficial political optics have improved, Biden's turning out to be just as hard as Trump on issues the EU really cares about, like Germany's plans to buy gas from Russia through the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.,center
While Biden has moved to defuse a long-standing tariff clash over subsidies for Airbus and Boeing, the new president has also left much of Trump's trade policy untouched, including tariffs on steel and a blockade of the World Trade Organization's court system.,center
Biden's drive for a "Buy American" policy, favoring U.S. companies in major public tenders, is even drawing countermeasures from the EU camp.,center
Biden's surprise move to publicly back India and South Africa's call for a waiver on the intellectual property of coronavirus vaccines was just the latest example in a set of maverick moves that not only run counter to the EU's economic interests, but that — unlike Trump — also called the bluff of Brussels' supposedly progressive leadership.,center
In a sign that even France, which officially backed the IP waiver, was not amused by the Biden administration's volte-face, Junior Europe Minister Clément Beaune told POLITICO that it was a "very political move, because so far they have exported nothing" in terms of vaccines.,center
But Van Brempt from the European Parliament pointed out that Biden had exposed Brussels' failure to act.,center
China has been another highly strategic area where the U.S. has made the EU look hypocritical for pontificating about "European values." Led by Germany and its all-important car industry, the EU rushed into a trade deal with Beijing at the end of last year, brushing off concerns about human rights and requests from the incoming Biden administration to consult on the agreement.,center
While it was Trump's Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who first labeled China's persecutions of Uyghurs in Xinjiang a "genocide," the Biden administration doubled down by formalizing the designation in a report — piling moral pressure on EU countries to also take a stand, and turning the eyes of the world to German carmaker Volkswagen's factory in the region.,center
As with the steel tariffs and WTO blockage, Biden has kept the stick and largely continued Trump's policies.,center
But, unlike Trump, Biden is simultaneously winning the moral high ground.,center
In another curveball move last month, Biden blindsided EU leaders.,center
Biden's plan to tax the 100 largest companies in the world would include the likes of Google and Facebook, but also non-digital giants such as Volkswagen and French oil and gas giant Total.,center
"My impression is that also our French friends in Paris are very much impressed [by Biden's tax initiative] and will give him a chance,” Altmaier said diplomatically.,center
Van Brempt from the Socialists said all these moves from Biden ramped up pressure on the EU to become more coherent.,center
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Friday called on President Donald Trump to make public a July phone call at the center of a report that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to find dirt on Biden’s family.,center
“If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country,” Biden said in a statement.,center
Biden’s comments come after a report that Trump pressured Ukrainian officials to investigate a potential political opponent — a call that reportedly prompted a whistleblower complaint by a member of the intelligence community that has been stonewalled from congressional review.,center
Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani admitted Thursday evening to asking Ukraine to investigate Biden during a rambling — and at times contradictory — interview, having previously claimed that Biden as vice president tried to shield his son Hunter from investigation over ties with a Ukrainian gas company.,center
Biden has denied those allegations.,center
Trump said the contents of his phone call with the Ukrainian president were “totally appropriate,” but did not answer whether he asked to investigate Biden, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the nature of the phone call.,center
Biden, but his state media agents of chaos sprung into action.,center
Russian President Vladimir Putin enjoyed a lie-in on Friday instead of watching the debate between U.S. President Joe Biden and Republican challenger Donald Trump.,center
Biden’s halting performance alarmed allies and triggered calls from Democrats that he should pull out of the election race.,center
State news agency RIA published a tally of how often the two candidates mentioned the name “Vladimir Putin” (seven times for both) and Russia (Trump: 16, Biden: 0).,center
Russian media also zeroed in on Biden’s comments that the Kremlin would not limit itself to conquering Ukraine and wanted to “re-establish what was part of the Soviet Empire,” and his description of Putin as a “war criminal.”,center
“Biden expectedly misspoke multiple times and stammered, Democrats have already called his performance a failure,” state news agency RIA concluded, leaving Trump out of its crosshairs altogether.,center
Several Russian media outlets also ran separate stories on Trump’s statement that “Ukraine’s not winning that war” and suffering heavy losses — a message that will be well received by many Russians — because of Biden “and his stupid decisions.”,center
Putin has said in the past that he prefers Biden to Trump because he’s “more experienced, more predictable” — but whether that’s a real endorsement for the man who called Putin a “killer” is questionable.,center
He has pledged to unleash fossil fuel production to lower energy costs and to walk away from President Joe Biden’s clean energy subsidy regime, which was designed to stimulate a clean industrial boom.,center
A Joe Biden victory in the U.S. presidential election would not mean Europe could rely on America for security as it used to do, Germany’s defense minister said Wednesday.,center
“Even if Joe Biden wins — which would mean we would certainly deal with each other in a different way — we must not forget that there are certain views that are shared by a large part of the American political class, for example on China or how to deal with Russia, where I would mention Nord Stream 2,” Kramp-Karrenbauer said, referring to the controversial gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany.,center
Kramp-Karrenbauer said that based on Biden’s statements to date, the economic and geopolitical rivalry between the United States and China would continue if he became president.,center
The EU just can’t wait to team up with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden.,center
It bluntly states an expectation that Biden will reverse Trump’s decision to quit the World Health Organization, and pointedly calls on the EU to push the U.S. “to lift sanctions against personnel of the International Criminal Court.”,center
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday denied that the United States had any role in or knowledge of an attempt to overthrow Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his government.,center
Speaking in Ankara, Biden — the highest-ranking official to visit Turkey since the failed coup on July 15 — told reporters that speculation had to be put to rest because the U.S. had “no advance warning” and no “complicity” in the putsch.,center
“The United States of America, did not, did not, have any foreknowledge of what befell you on July 15,” Biden said, calling the coup attempt “a cowardly act” and a “treacherous act” on the part of a group within “your military.”,center
Biden said U.S. judicial officials are reviewing the evidence and added that he understands “the intense feelings the people of Turkey” have against the cleric.,center
Once the evidence is properly reviewed, the U.S. will not stand in the way of the extradition process, Biden said.,center
“We have no, no, no, no interest whatsoever to protect anyone who has done harm to our ally,” Biden said.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden warned Russian President Vladimir Putin not to use chemical or tactical nuclear weapons in his invasion of Ukraine, saying there would be a “consequential” response.,center
Don’t,” Biden said in a televised interview with U.S. broadcaster CBS that is due to air on Sunday night.,center
Biden’s warning comes after a surprise counteroffensive by Kyiv put Russian forces in retreat in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region.,center
Asked how the U.S. would respond if Putin were to use chemical or tactical nuclear weapons, Biden said: “It’ll be consequential.,center
Joe Biden has led nearly every U.S. Democratic primary poll without doing anything.,center
Biden’s U.S. presidential campaign-in-waiting has ramped up over the last several weeks — calling donors across the country and tapping decades-old friendships to line up support from major Democratic Party figures, organized labor, members of Congress and elected officials from early presidential states, according to people with direct knowledge of Biden’s campaign strategy.,center
POLITICO also spoke to donors who’ve received calls from Biden’s team, potential campaign aides who have been interviewed for jobs and stakeholders in early primary and caucus states who were asked to pitch in their support.,center
As Biden seeks on-the-ground labor support in early primary and caucus states, he has all but locked in the endorsement of the International Association of Firefighters, the union that helped boost John Kerry to the Democratic nomination in 2004.,center
This year, union President Harold Schaitberger said, the 315,000-member union plans to quickly deploy an organized effort to boost Biden in the early-voting states.,center
Once Biden’s announcement goes live, Schaitberger continued, “our executive board will be prepared to immediately meet and formally take a position on the primary and we’ll likely be prepared to make that announcement on the 29th.”,center
As Biden’s team works to lock down national labor support, it is also chasing union backing in early states like Iowa, where his aides have already interviewed staff.,center
The early activity is fueled by Biden’s long relationships within the Democratic Party and the bonds he built as Barack Obama’s vice president, which vaulted him to the top of the primary pack this year without rushing into the race early.,center
But Biden’s team sees an opportunity to generate something Biden hasn’t yet had this year with a strong entrance: forward momentum, created by proving he has what it takes to compete in a historically large primary field before going toe-to-toe with President Donald Trump.,center
Asked if she will be with Biden: “100 percent.,center
Former Nevada Democratic chairman Sam Lieberman said Biden has already won his endorsement and he expects “labor could be easily persuaded to support Joe Biden if he was in the mix.”,center

The long-awaited campaign is finally in the works: Biden’s team has planned for a video announcement this week.,center
Three people who talked to Biden or his team told POLITICO the announcement could come on Thursday, though the timing remained in flux as of late Monday.,center
Biden’s formal announcement is to be followed by related launch events, including a fundraiser in Philadelphia.,center
“They’re going to launch strategically all over the country,” an operative with knowledge of Biden’s strategy said.,center
In recent weeks, Biden’s team or Biden himself have reached out to donors around the country asking for commitments for a launch this week.,center
In Philadelphia, a group of donors were asking supporters to write checks even before the fundraiser slated to be held later this week, once Biden is officially in the race.,center
Former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, who is helping organize the fundraiser, said he’s been in contact with Biden’s team and is still awaiting final word on timing for the event, which would follow Biden’s announcement.,center
Biden’s call for donors comes as he’s expected to be outpaced on small-donor fundraising by others in the field, including Senator Bernie Sanders.,center
Stephen Cozen, an attorney and longtime Biden ally, said the fundraising effort aims “to demonstrate to others that he’s got this very broad band of support at the lowest level, not necessarily even at the highest level, where I’m sure — I know for a fact — there are people with a lot of money sitting out there waiting for Joe to get in.,center
Biden’s call for donors comes as he’s expected to be outpaced on small-donor fundraising by others in the field, including Senator Bernie Sanders, who so far has the most consistent, highest polling aside from Biden.,center
But it’s not a Bernie list,” said a Biden campaign surrogate.,center
BERLIN — The German government has refuted a White House line that U.S. President Joe Biden agreed to the delivery of Abrams battle tanks to Ukraine only at Germany’s insistence and against the recommendation of his military officials.,center
On Sunday, Biden’s security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told ABC News: “The president originally decided against sending … Abrams tanks … because his military told them that they would not be useful on the battlefield in this fight.”,center
In the interest of “alliance unity” and “to insure Ukraine got what it wanted,” Biden agreed to the delivery of Abrams tanks even though they aren’t what Ukraine needs most, Sullivan explained.,center
Büchner reiterated an earlier statement by chief government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit that Chancellor Olaf Scholz had never told Biden the delivery of German Leopard tanks was conditional upon delivery of Abrams tanks.,center
NEW YORK — French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Joe Biden will speak later Wednesday, according to an Elysée official.,center
Macron expects Biden to “recognize that the discussions and consultations that should have taken place did not and that this raises questions of trust,” the official said.,center
Regardless of incoming U.S. President Joe Biden's wariness, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron raced to finalize a landmark investment agreement with China at the end of last year.,center
It's hardly as if Biden weren't already trying to put out fires in Europe given the precipitous and chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.,center
In recent days, in a bid to shore up alliances, Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan has telephoned Romanian Foreign Minister and National Security Advisor Bogdan Aurescu, Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė and Hiski Haukkala, secretary general and chief of cabinet for Finnish President Sauli Niinistö.,center
Joseph Biden, the US vice-president, is to meet ambassadors of NATO member states in Brussels next Tuesday (10 March) to discuss alliance operations in Afghanistan, according to diplomats.,center
Biden’s visit is a response to “a certain frustration” by NATO members that the administration of President Barack Obama has not consulted them sufficiently in its policy review of the Afghanistan mission, a senior diplomat said.,center
Biden will be the second top American official to come to Brussels in the space of less than a week, following a visit – currently under way – by Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state.,center
Biden ‘the salesman’,center
Richard Holbrooke, the US special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, is not thought to be part of Biden’s mission next week.,center
A diplomat suggested that Biden was very well received at a security conference last month in Munich and was now a “salesman” for the administration.,center
Clinton told reporters after today’s meetings that Biden would “solicit last-minute opinions from all who wish to participate”.,center
An EU diplomat confirmed that an American advance team was in town today to prepare Biden’s visit.,center
LONDON — U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss will meet U.S. President Joe Biden this weekend as the pair prepare for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in London.,center
On Sunday she will meet Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and Polish President Andrzej Duda, as well as Biden.,center
Volodymyr Zelenskyy has brushed off an embarrassing mix-up that saw U.S. President Joe Biden confuse the Ukrainian leader with Russia’s Vladimir Putin.,center
“Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin,” Biden said on Thursday when introducing Zelenskyy ahead of a speech at the NATO summit in Washington.,center
While the 81-year-old Democrat quickly corrected himself, the gaffe has fueled speculation about his fitness for office ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November, with dozens of his own allies calling for Biden to step down in favor of a younger candidate.,center
LONDON — President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak are preparing a “foundational” U.S. / U.K. trade agreement designed to be wrapped up before both men face re-election next year, documents leaked to POLITICO show.,center
Bloomberg reported back in April that the U.K. was hoping to restart trade talks with the U.S. when Biden visited Belfast later that month.,center
The Biden administration wants concessions on agriculture, but the U.K.’s Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs is “blocking this,” said a U.K. government official granted anonymity as they were not approved to speak to the media.,center
The Biden administration is not offering this to any trade partners.,center
Why are Europeans so upset about Joe Biden?,center
Were they to listen carefully, they would realize that Biden sounds, if anything, quintessentially European.,center
When Biden took office, announcing that “America is back,” Europeans, traumatized by four years of Donald Trump’s presidency, had replied suspiciously: “For how long?” Since then, Biden has taken a series of moves that suggest the question is still an open one.,center
There is nothing the Biden administration has said or done that suggests a diminished commitment to European security.,center
Spelling out his foreign policy in the wake of the debacle in Afghanistan, Biden declared that “human rights will be the center of our foreign policy.,center
Gone are the days of democracy promotion through military interventions and nation building — as Biden’s foreign policy doctrine rightfully states.,center
And it will entail devising new multilateral formats to support liberal values, whether through new institutions or more informal settings, like Biden’s plans for a summit of democratic countries.,center
Most importantly, it will require Europeans to put themselves at ease with Biden’s approach and work together with the U.S. in the mutual interest of both sides of the Atlantic.,center
Vice President Joe Biden will not pursue the Democratic nomination for president in 2016, he said on Wednesday, turning down a chance to throw his hat into the ring for the third time after a months-long deliberation process that kept his party guessing.,center
“I’ve said all along what I’ve said time and again to others: that it may very well be that [the grieving] process, by the time we get through it, closes the window on mounting a realistic campaign for president: that it might close,” Biden said just after noon on Wednesday, referring to the May death of his son, Beau, of brain cancer.,center
Bernie Sanders — the insurgent progressive challenger — Biden opted not to fight what would have been an uphill battle, making Clinton’s path to the nomination clearer.,center
The decision ends a long period of uncertainty for the party: Biden had never truly ruled out running for president, but he was largely sidelined when the conversation started centering on Clinton by late 2014.,center
After the death of his son, Biden’s timeline appeared to shift once again.,center
Rumors and speculation about his plans cropped up frequently into the fall of 2015 — particularly after Biden confidant former Sen.,center
Biden was joined by his wife, Jill, and a handful of top aides — including his sister Valerie Biden Owens and former Sen.,center
Arguing that Democrats should run on Obama’s record, Biden also continued the apparent jabs at Clinton that he had rolled out in recent days.,center
Biden’s ultimate decision not to run mirrors his situation twelve years ago, when he chose not to pursue the 2004 nomination after considering it.,center
This time around, Biden had no political or campaign infrastructure in place, while both Clinton and Sanders have been running for months, and each have full-scale staffs at their headquarters and in early-voting states.,center
Biden signaled no intention to back Clinton or any of her opponents, instead promising to play a role in the 2016 debate.,center
On top of declaring the importance of finding a cure for cancer, Biden said he would use the remainder of his time as vice president to influence the national discussion.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden confused Emmanuel Macron, the current French president, with François Mitterrand, who led France from 1981 to 1995 and died in 1996.,center
In a speech at a campaign rally in Las Vegas, while telling a story about the G7 summit that took place in England in June 2021 and which Macron attended, Biden said: “Right after I was elected, I went to a G7 meeting in southern England.,center
In June, Biden — who is running for reelection and is set to face Republican challenger Donald Trump in a November rematch of the 2020 vote — had confused the war in Ukraine with that in Iraq, saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin was “losing the war in Iraq.”,center
He’s losing the war at home, and he has become a bit of a pariah around the world,” Biden said.,center
All eyes are on London and Paris after United States President Joe Biden’s decision to allow Ukraine to use American missiles to hit targets inside Russia.,center
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the G20 leaders' summit in Rio de Janeiro overnight on Monday, Macron said he thought President Joe Biden made "a good decision" in allowing Ukraine use American-made to strike inside Russia.,center
Pressed on whether the U.K. government will follow Biden’s move on long-range missiles, a No. 10 Downing Street spokesperson said the U.K. had “been consistent throughout that providing specific details on operational matters would only serve to benefit [Russian President Vladimir] Putin during an ongoing illegal war.”,center
Biden’s move got wider European support.,center
Just as Joe Biden is insisting the U.S. government should "Buy American," Europe is on the verge of rolling out a countermeasure that will heap pressure on EU member countries to "Buy European.",center
But Biden's increased emphasis on "Buy American" is helping break years of deadlock, as are fears that China could ultimately become a significant player in landmark tenders.,center
Washington has joined the WTO's procurement agreement, but the EU's trade chief, Valdis Dombrovskis, has suggested Biden's push contravened U.S. commitments.,center
LONDON — Boris Johnson joined world leaders in congratulating Joe Biden on his victory in the U.S. presidential election, with a pledge to work closely on climate policy, trade and security.,center
His political rival Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour party, was more fulsome in his congratulations, calling Biden’s election “an important moment for the world.”,center
“Their victory is one for hope and unity over dishonesty and division,” Starmer said in a statement issued minutes after television networks began projecting Biden’s victory.,center
Trump’s most fervent supporter in British politics, Nigel Farage, described Biden’s election win as merely “a temporary set back” for Trump.,center
Predicting that, despite Trump’s looming legal challenges, “the most likely outcome is that we carry on with Biden as president,” Farage told TimesRadio that he expected Trump to remain as “leader of the Republican Party.”,center
The U.K. government will have far more alignment on foreign policy matters with a Biden administration, but many observers have predicted a cool relationship between Johnson — the figurehead of Brexit — and the president-elect, who opposed the U.K.’s departure from the EU and as recently as December described Johnson (whom he has not met) as “a physical and emotional clone” of Trump.,center
A key area of convergence could be climate change diplomacy, with Biden vowing to bring the U.S. back into the Paris climate agreement on his first day in office and to put the country on the path to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and with Johnson due to host the COP26 UN climate summit in Glasgow in November 2021.,center
There is much to celebrate in the new foreign policy initiatives being planned by U.S. President-elect Joe Biden and his team.,center
First, Biden is misreading the room.,center
As he tries to “lead the world,” Biden will find that far from mourning the United States’ retreat, demand for old-fashioned one-size-fits-all American leadership is in short supply, including in some parts of Europe.,center
Any attempt to reengage with Iran, a top priority for Biden, will require close coordination with Russia and China.,center
Setting up a new D-10 — an exclusive club of democracies — may seem the perfect solution for a new Biden administration anxious to quickly distinguish itself from its predecessor.,center
Biden’s election says more about the strength of democracies than any communiqué issued after a D-10 meeting ever could.,center
12 has been postponed following the cancellation of U.S. President Joe Biden's visit to Germany.,center
At the end of a three-day trip to Germany, Biden was due to chair a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a loose alliance of more than 50 countries known as the Ramstein Format, named for the air base in which it is usually held.,center
However, as Hurricane Milton bears down on the Florida coast this week the White House announced early Tuesday that Biden's trip to Germany wouldn't happen.,center
Ahead of the Ramstein meeting, Biden was set to hold talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Berlin on the Saturday morning, while Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was also set to present his so-called Victory Plan at Ramstein later in the day with the hope of securing further military support.,center
Even if Joe Biden replaces Donald Trump as US president, Europe will have to learn to carry its share of the burden.,center
With those four words, uttered at the 2019 Munich Security Conference, Joe Biden warmed the hearts of Europeans despairing at the erratic, indifferent and at times openly hostile foreign policy of U.S. President Donald Trump.,center
But even if the Democratic presidential contender wins the election (an increasingly likely “if” should Biden prove able to maintain his advantage in the polls), it’ll take more than warm feelings to get the transatlantic relationship back on track.,center
Like Trump, Biden will expect Europe and NATO to carry more of the security burden in the Middle East.,center
“We can’t just wait till Biden arrives.,center
In his speech in Munich, Biden called for a reform of NATO to meet threats unique to the 21st century and promised “serious coordination and consensus-building.” In recent speeches and articles, he has vowed to return on “day one” of his presidency to the Paris accord on fighting climate change and to the World Health Organization.,center
But while a Democratic administration in Washington can be expected to consult allies more, be more active diplomatically and be more supportive of international institutions, a Biden presidency will not mark a return to the post-World War II era in which Europe could afford to live comfortably under the American umbrella.,center
Would a Biden administration be more willing to step in if Turkey used force to press its continental shelf claims in the gas-rich eastern Mediterranean?,center
Like Trump, Biden will expect Europe and NATO to carry more of the security burden in the Middle East.,center
The real litmus test of U.S.-European cooperation under a Biden administration is likely to come over China, on which the Europeans are far from united among themselves but are eager to avoid being dragged into a new Cold War by Trump.,center
How a Biden administration approaches Xi Jinping’s China may be the big test of EU-U.S. relations | Pool photo by Kim Kyung-Hoon/Getty Images,center
Tony Blinken, one of Biden’s senior foreign policy advisers, says how to handle Beijing is the most important question a Democratic president would face.,center
A Biden administration would approach it by working with allies and “showing up in institutions instead of going AWOL.”,center
If Biden makes good on his day-one promises, Europeans should be ready to respond with “deliverables” of their own, to borrow the ghastly bureaucratic terminology.,center
A more self-confident Europe should offer a President Biden a grown-up partnership, but not subservience.,center
It is not certain that Biden would be willing or able to end this constant irritant in transatlantic ties, which is often spearheaded by Congress.,center
A more self-confident Europe should offer a President Biden a grown-up partnership, but not subservience.,center
If elected, Joe Biden would be 82 on inauguration day in 2025, and 86 on leaving the White House in January 2029.,center
If his nickname “der Alte” (“the old man”) is one day bestowed upon Biden, the U.S. president would share it with a true friend of America.,center
Beijing announced plans on Friday to overhaul Hong Kong's electoral system to weaken the pro-democracy camp, paving the way for what could be the first big test of whether U.S. President Joe Biden can muster an international alliance to tackle human rights abuses in China.,center
And it also represents a major test of Biden's approach to China.,center
But the big question is whether Biden will see Friday's move as a moment to try to pull together an international front to counter Beijing.,center
The Tory former minister said the length of time between the fall of Kabul and the phone call between Boris Johnson and Joe Biden on Tuesday was a sign of strained U.K.-U.S. relations, adding that it would have been “inconceivable” under previous administrations, including that of Donald Trump.,center
A British diplomat argued the silence from Washington said less about Joe Biden’s indifference to the U.K. and more about “Biden trying to minimize the whole thing for the U.S. public, and consequently avoid lots of calls to foreign leaders.”,center
Apart from Johnson, the only other foreign leader Biden has spoken to since Sunday is Germany’s Angela Merkel.,center
His most open difference in posture from Biden has been his remarks on the Afghan military, paying tribute to their “bravery and sacrifice” in a House of Commons statement on Wednesday.,center
ROME — U.S. President Joe Biden on Sunday blamed Russia and China for any disappointment over the level of commitment by G20 leaders to fight climate change.,center
“With regard to the disappointment, the disappointment relates to the fact that … not only Russia but China basically didn’t show up in terms of any commitments to deal with climate change,” Biden said at his news conference at the end of the two-day leaders’ summit in Rome.,center
“And there’s a reason why people should be disappointed in that,” Biden added.,center
Biden acknowledged the progress but also name-checked Saudi Arabia among countries that he argued are still not doing enough.,center
“We passed a number of things here to end the subsidization of coal,” Biden said.,center
“More has to be done,” Biden said, continuing his riff on climate change.,center
EU leaders weren’t present when Joe Biden met Vladimir Putin in Geneva this week but their territory will be a testing ground for whether Moscow has decided to change its ways.,center
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called U.S. President Joe Biden’s recent remarks on nation-building in Afghanistan “arguable”  on Thursday and blamed the US administration for making financial investments producing “very modest results” in the country.,center
Speaking to MEPs from the European Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee in a video meeting on the current situation in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover, Borrell expressed confusion over Biden’s recent declaration that the U.S. intervention there had “always been preventing a terrorist attack on American homeland” and was “never supposed to be creating a unified centralized democracy.”,center
Borrell’s remarks echoed concerns in many EU capitals about Biden’s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan and allow the country to collapse into the arms of the Taliban.,center
US secretary of state says if former Vice President Joe Biden behaved inappropriately then ‘we need to know.’,center
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday he hasn’t seen the Ukraine whistleblower complaint, but if former Vice President Joe Biden behaved inappropriately then “we need to know.”,center
Following reports that President Donald Trump pressured Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden’s son, Hunter Biden — which led to a whistleblower complaint and stalled congressional review — Pompeo joined many Trump allies in pivoting the conversation to discrediting the Democratic 2020 front-runner.,center
Biden has been attacked by those who say that while he was vice president, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid from Ukraine and called for the firing of a state prosecutor looking into a gas company where Hunter Biden held a board position.,center
Trump himself has doubled down on these claims against Biden.,center
“If Vice President Biden behaved inappropriately, if he was protecting his son and intervened with the Ukrainian leadership in a way that was corrupt, I do think we need to get to the bottom of that,” Pompeo said on ABC’s “This Week.“,center
He added, “America cannot have our elections interfered with … If there was that kind of activity engaged in by Vice President Biden, we need to know.”,center
Trump tweeted Saturday that the call was “perfectly fine and routine.” But critics of the administration, including Biden, have labeled Trump’s actions as “an overwhelming abuse of power” and “betrayal of our nation.”,center
Think tank known as a training ground for Biden advisers says president should end US opposition to EU defense integration.,center
That’s according to a new report by the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank with close ties to the Biden administration.,center
The report, obtained by POLITICO in advance of its release on Wednesday, urges President Joe Biden to encourage the EU to develop hard-power military capabilities and calls on him to abandon decades of opposition to EU defense integration by previous U.S. leaders, under the guise of preventing wasteful duplication with NATO — which remains orthodox thinking for most American military commanders, and even for many EU governments.,center
The report, published just 10 days before Biden makes his first trip abroad as president for G7 and NATO summits, calls out Washington for hounding European allies to spend more on their militaries to reach NATO’s 2 percent of GDP spending target, while preventing the EU from pursuing initiatives that would save money and improve fighting readiness.,center
The report is likely to generate attention in part because the Center for American Progress has become known as a training ground for Biden administration officials, with dozens of the think tank’s alumni now in positions at the White House, the State Department, the Pentagon and other government agencies.,center
The think tank’s former president and chief executive, Neera Tanden, recently joined the White House as a senior adviser to Biden, a role that might make her even more powerful than budget director, the post for which she was initially nominated but withdrew when it became clear she could not win Senate confirmation.,center
Whether the report will persuade Biden, an avowed supporter of NATO, to shift his thinking remains to be seen.,center
TBILISI, Georgia — U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday criticized the conduct of Georgia’s recent parliamentary election, which was marred by violence, and joined calls by European leaders for a transparent investigation into possible violations.,center
Biden, who noted that international and domestic observers hadn’t described the elections as “free and fair,” called on the Georgian government to begin an “inclusive dialogue with all political forces in Georgia about restoring election integrity.”,center
Biden also urged Georgian officials to repeal the country’s controversial law on “foreign agents,” which was introduced earlier this year and is widely believed to have been drawn from the Russian playbook for silencing government critics.,center
The wait to speak to Joe Biden is over for several European leaders.,center
In fairly quick succession, Biden chatted with the leaders of the U.K., Ireland, Germany and France — although his team declined to comment on the order of the calls.,center
Boris Johnson confirmed on Twitter that he had spoken to Biden, whom he has never met, and said he was looking forward to working together on “shared priorities — from tackling climate change, to promoting democracy and building back better from the pandemic.”,center
A Downing Street spokesperson said shortly afterward that Johnson had used the call to personally invite Biden to the COP26 U.N. climate summit, to be hosted in Glasgow in November next year.,center
Despite the strength and history of U.K.-U.S. ties, many observers had predicted a cool relationship between Johnson and Biden, given the latter’s opposition to Brexit and the U.K. prime minister’s past comments about Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.,center
The spokesperson said Johnson had “warmly congratulated” Biden on his election as well as passing on his congratulations to Kamala Harris “on her historic achievement.”,center
On Brexit, Biden has previously made clear his concerns regarding the U.K. Internal Market Bill, legislation that would undercut parts of the U.K.’s exit deal with the EU and which Brussels says could undermine the Good Friday Agreement.,center
A No 10 official said Johnson and Biden had “talked about the importance of implementing Brexit in such a way that upholds the Good Friday Agreement, and the PM assured the president-elect that would be the case.”,center
In a statement, Biden’s team said he “expressed his desire to strengthen the special relationship and re-double cooperation on issues of mutual concern.”,center
Irish PM Micheál Martin said on Twitter on Tuesday that he had received a call from Biden, but deleted the tweet shortly after.,center
The Irish government later put out a statement saying the two had a “warm conversation” and Biden “recalled his strong Irish roots and his visit to Ireland with his family in 2016.”,center
In the statement from Biden’s team, it said he “highlighted his desire to strengthen the enduring personal, cultural, and economic ties between the United States and Ireland.”,center
In a short statement, Angela Merkel’s spokesman said the German chancellor had “expressed the wish for close and trusting future cooperation” during her call with Biden.,center
On Tuesday’s call, Merkel and Biden agreed “that transatlantic cooperation is of great importance in view of the large number of global challenges,” the spokesman said.,center
Biden “praised” Merkel’s leadership and “welcomed the opportunity to cooperate on a shared agenda with the EU,” according to the statement from his team.,center
Biden also chatted with French President Emmanuel Macron, the Elysée Palace said.,center
Macron reassured Biden and Harris “of his desire to work together” on issues such as climate, health, fighting terrorism, and defending fundamental rights.,center
Joe Biden was back on the (virtual) stage of the Munich Security Conference Friday.,center
“When I last spoke in Munich, I was a private citizen, I was a professor, not an elected official,” Biden told the conference chairman, Wolfgang Ischinger, who was veritably glowing as he emceed a panel that included the American president, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.,center
“But I said at that time, ‘We will be back,’ and I am a man of my word,” Biden said.,center
The speech, following a videoconference of G7 leaders convened by U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, marked a triumphant return to the world stage for Biden, the former vice president and globetrotting senator who long chaired the Foreign Relations Committee while in Congress.,center
Much of Biden’s message felt familiar — and for many listeners, especially those in Europe, that was the best part.,center
“Democracy doesn’t happen by accident,” Biden said at one point.,center
This year, Biden’s speech could not have been more different.,center
Biden acknowledged that the world, reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, is far different in 2021 and facing an array of new challenges.,center
But unlike Trump — who berated allies for not spending more on their militaries, expressed affinity for dictators and generally sowed unease on nearly all of his trips abroad — Biden offered only steadfast reassurance.,center
Where Trump called the European Union a foe, Biden held it up as a close partner.,center
Where Trump warned NATO allies that the U.S. could go its own way, Biden said the alliance was unshakeable.,center
Invoking the collective defense clause of the NATO treaty, Biden said: “We’ll keep faith with Article 5.,center
Biden also had tough words for Russia.,center
Biden expressed support for Ukraine, part of which Russia annexed in 2014, and vowed to fight Russian meddling in the West, including Moscow’s digital assaults.,center
On coronavirus vaccines, Biden pledged an additional $2 billion to the COVAX international vaccine-access initiative, a vow that comes as wealthy nations have faced criticism for not helping to deploy coronavirus vaccines faster in the developing world.,center
Biden also talked about fighting climate change, and mentioned teaming up with allies to confront China.,center
Biden also talked about cooperation in space exploration, including efforts to explore Mars.,center
“The range of challenges the U.S. and Europe must take on together is broad and complex,” Biden said, noting he was eager to listen to Merkel and Macron’s speeches.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden promised continued security assistance “including advanced air defense systems” to Ukraine late on Monday, following Russian missile attacks targeting civilians and energy infrastructures.,center
Biden spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy to express “his condemnation of Russia’s missile strikes across Ukraine,” according to a White House statement after the call.,center
In true Joe Biden form, the entire enterprise was always a little haphazard.,center
Long after the will-he-won’t-he speculation reached full tilt, Biden asked his chief of staff, Steve Ricchetti, to put together a briefing book on where Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and the other Democratic 2016 contenders stood on the issues.,center
He needed to sleep on it, Biden said as he wrapped up calls Tuesday evening from the Naval Observatory.,center
On Wednesday at around 9 a.m., Ricchetti was telling people he wasn’t sure what Biden would do.,center
But conversations with people in the Biden orbit — advisers, White House staffers and others involved with the discussions about a possible presidential run over the last few weeks and days — help explain why the prospects of a run ebbed and flowed so dramatically: Biden was ebbing and flowing that dramatically himself.,center
Yet many of them went into the weekend thinking that at the last moment, Biden was going to be a yes.,center
On Sunday night, Draft Biden staffers were locking down social media and URLs for a new super PAC that they expected to start to support a run.,center
Then Biden arrived.,center
By midday Monday, people in touch with Biden had turned completely around.,center
before Beau Biden’s health started its irreversible decline, he had already started transferring his dreams of being president onto his son,center
Throughout the final days of the would-be campaign, Obama stuck to what he’d been telling top aides: Biden is still very much in the grieving process.,center
The president held back — “a sounding board,” is how Obama’s spokesman Eric Schultz described his role on Wednesday afternoon — telling people how important it was that Biden make the decision on his own timetable.,center
Harold Schaitberger, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, who spoke to the vice president earlier in the week, came away feeling optimistic enough that he called several reporters Tuesday afternoon to tell them his union was acting as though Biden were going to declare.,center
They’d sent it to Biden’s advisers — Ricchetti, the preparer of all the plans; Mike Donilon, his longtime political consultant and the chief agitator for a run; Ted Kaufman, his best friend and former chief of staff; and his son Hunter, who was also talking through a run with supporters.,center
Shortly after 11 a.m. Wednesday, Kaufman, Dr. Jill Biden and Valerie Biden Owens, the vice president’s sister and his closest adviser, arrived at the White House.,center
The healing process, Biden had famously told grieving military families months before, was when the memory of your loved one brings a smile to your face before it brings a tear.,center
The good news, Biden said, is that he and his family are finally at that point with his beloved son Beau, who died at the end of May.,center
Since August, Biden staffers had reconciled themselves to the reality that the presidential speculation was probably going to end without much warning.,center
All those weeks, close Biden friends, family and former aides were expressing their own anxiety.,center
Part of what was happening, people close to the vice president said, was that before Beau Biden’s health started its irreversible decline, he had already started transferring his dreams of being president onto his son.,center
Biden knew that the sudden late interest in him had a lot to do with the outpouring of sympathy over his son’s death.,center
Schaitberger pushed back on the sense Biden seemed to be giving off that he felt he was being bullied out of the race by the Clinton campaign or by a world of Democrats and journalists getting impatient.,center
He needed to make a decision before she arrived at the hearing, people in the pro camp urged Biden, because otherwise he’d look calculating — like he was just waiting to evaluate her performance.,center
To a number of people helping talk through a run with Biden, the Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Des Moines on Saturday never looked like a good place to start, despite much media speculation to the contrary.,center
By the end of September, people eager for a run who’d talked to Biden were already talking about what looked like a launch strategy: skip the first debate, leak that he was running this week, stage a kickoff the week of October 26.,center
Biden listened — in his office, on the phone, sitting by the pool at the Naval Observatory.,center
The second and third-circle members of the Biden orbit who were told to be ready to get on a conference call to hear about the decision first, whenever it came.,center
But by Monday afternoon, a chill had gone out among people who were pushing Biden.,center
Then came South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn, dousing cold water on Biden in an interview with the Huffington Post that landed late on Monday afternoon, taking those around both men by surprise.,center
A month ago, Clyburn caught a lot of attention for saying how open he was to a Biden candidacy and how anxious he was about Clinton’s email server.,center
Frantic messages started going back and forth between Biden’s advisers and Clyburn’s.,center
Biden advisers’ whole concept of a race assumed poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, which they’d chalk up in large part to his late entry.,center
More than that, Biden idolizes Clyburn, particularly for his civil rights work.,center
People familiar with Biden’s thinking described the comments as a sort of reality check to a man already feeling nervous about his prospects.,center
Biden and Clyburn didn’t speak after the article posted.,center
They didn’t believe Biden was going to run.,center
They didn’t have meetings to plan for what a Biden campaign would mean for the White House operationally, or politically for the president.,center
After walking back from the Rose Garden with Jill Biden and the president, and after hugs in the Oval Office, Biden spent the afternoon making calls.,center
And still among the Biden devotees, a hope remains.,center
“I’m sad our country won’t be able to see Joe Biden as one of our greatest presidents,” said South Carolina Rep.,center
The Commission chief's speech at the ambassadors' conference, which was held virtually this year, comes three days after the announcement of Joe Biden's election as the 46th president of the United States.,center
The response to climate change also needed EU-U.S. leadership, said von der Leyen, hailing Biden's commitment for the U.S. to reenter the Paris climate agreement.,center
The Commission chief also flagged issues where it may be harder to find agreement with a Biden administration, raising the controversial topic of taxes on digital companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday he believed Russia was days away from invading Ukraine.,center
As he departed the White House, Biden told reporters that the threat of invasion was “very high” and that “every indication we have is they’re prepared to go into Ukraine to attack Ukraine.”,center
Biden said that despite Russian claims that some of the more than 100,000 troops it has amassed on the border with Ukraine had been withdrawn, “they have not moved any of their troops out.,center
Asked if Russia was going ahead with an invasion, Biden said: “Yes.,center
Biden was also asked if he planned to call the Russian president and replied: “I”m not calling — I have no plans to call Putin.”,center
Biden on Sunday gave Ukraine permission to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deeper into Russia, a long-awaited step as Ukrainian troops who are occupying part of Russia’s Kursk region brace for an assault by tens of thousands of Russian and North Korean troops.,center
The U.S. position was made starkly clear by Antony Blinken, President Joe Biden's pick for secretary of state.,center
During his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, he said: "I’m determined to do whatever I can to prevent that completion," and that Biden "would have us use every persuasive tool that we have to convince our friends and partners including Germany not to move forward with it.”,center
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday she wants to discuss the pipeline and related U.S. sanctions with Biden's new team.,center
Biden campaigned on a return to normalcy in transatlantic relations, but U.S. senators have already questioned whether his administration is willing to stand firm on sanctions when faced with German pressure to back off.,center
"There will also be different opinions with the Biden administration," Merkel said.,center
Former Vice President Joe Biden vowed Thursday that, if elected to the White House in November, he would not use his new executive powers to pardon President Donald Trump of any potential crimes.,center
The pledge from the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee came during a virtual town hall on MSNBC, when Biden was asked by a voter whether he would be willing to commit “to not pulling a President Ford” and pardoning Trump “under the pretense of healing the nation.”,center
I commit,” Biden responded, adding: “It’s hands off completely.,center
A possible pardon of Trump by Biden would represent the second such exoneration of a former president by his successor in modern American history.,center
Biden alluded to both of those actions Thursday, lamenting how “we never saw anything like the prostitution of [the presidency] like we see it today,” and arguing that “what’s going on is an absolute travesty.,center
The attorney general will be the latest member of Biden’s Cabinet to make a trip to the war-torn country.,center
With nothing better to do after retirement, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden will be traveling to Russia in search of the “Russian soul” — at least in the fantasies of the country’s television directors.,center
Russian media on Tuesday widely reported a press release from the TNT entertainment channel announcing it would start filming a comedy series titled “Goodbye,” starring a fictional Biden traveling to Russia incognito to “submerge himself in our reality” and “understand the Russian soul.”,center
According to the Russian TV makers’ plot, Biden loses his passport on his first day in Russia (inadvertently suggesting the president might not want to stick around otherwise) and be forced to live in an ordinary Russian apartment block and teach English to make enough money to go home.,center
Biden will be played by Dmitry Dyuzhev, a well-known Russian actor who, in the press release, said he saw the role as an opportunity to “branch out,” and described the project as “a brave experiment.”,center
Joe Biden has won the U.S. presidential election, after securing key votes in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.,center
The call for Biden came as Trump and his campaign disputed the results and vowed to challenge them.,center
Merkel and Macron set for Biden boost.,center
Boris Johnson has work to do to woo Joe Biden should he become US president next week.,center
One more defeat at the hands of the far right this weekend will almost certainly spell the end, and Scholz could very well share the fate of U.S. President Joe Biden — thrust aside by his panicking party to make way for a candidate who can avoid a massacre in a national election next year.,center
French President Emmanuel Macron snatched an unexpected win from his U.S counterpart during a visit to Washington on Thursday, getting Joe Biden to suggest that European companies could benefit from a controversial American subsidies package.,center
Fury has been boiling over in Europe after it became clear that Biden's Inflation Reduction Act — a $369 billion package for green industry — could drain investment out of the EU and into the U.S. Big car-making nations like France and Germany had complained that the U.S. law was potentially illegal for discriminating against foreign companies in the electric vehicle sector and encouraging consumers to "Buy American.",center
At an affable news conference with Macron on Thursday, however, Biden conceded way more ground than had been thought possible.,center
That logic seemed to make headway with Biden.,center
It still remains to be seen, however, how much can be achieved in practice and whether Biden was making more concessions in his friendly public appearance with Macron than he will really be able to deliver.,center
It’s unclear how far Biden's administration will go in resolving issues for the Europeans at a technical level, as teams on either side still need to hash out the details.,center
For the French, Biden’s unexpected concession paradoxically risks undermining Macron’s campaign at home to get the EU to roll out its own protectionist answer to the IRA.,center
Hearts are breaking in the White House and in the Obama alumni network just thinking about a Joe Biden presidential run.,center
Biden versus Hillary Clinton would tear at loyalties, emotions, political calculations — and in some cases, actual contracts already signed with Clinton’s Brooklyn campaign headquarters.,center
In interviews, current and former White House staffers say that as Biden has ratcheted up the seriousness of his explorations, including having aides reach out to former top political operatives for President Barack Obama to gauge interest, the situation looks very different from when they’d been assuming she’d be the only real Democratic candidate in 2016.,center
A Biden run would upend that.,center
They know how hard it would be for Biden to win, even if progressive icon Elizabeth Warren were to back him.,center
While many say they’ll stick by Clinton, several members of the Obama orbit acknowledge they’ve become hesitant to say positive things publicly about Clinton, worried that this could be interpreted as tipping Obama’s hand toward her or insulting Biden.,center
It’s not so much lingering animosity against Clinton from the 2008 campaign, that’s dividing loyalties, but the intense affection so many of them have developed for Biden as part of Obama’s team, and the personal connection he’s formed with so many of them.,center
“If Joe Biden was elected president, he’d be extraordinary and historic, but I think the odds are pretty long at this point,” said Bill Burton, a top press aide for the 2008 campaign and during the first term in the White House.,center
Part of the problem is Biden’s timing.,center
If Biden got in at this point, “a lot of Obama folks would be like, ‘We love him,’” said another Obama campaign aide, “but I don’t see the path for him.”,center
But Brian VanRiper, who ran veterans outreach for Obama during the 2008 Iowa caucuses and became friendly with Beau Biden while the latter was campaigning for his father in the caucuses, said he’s already given to Draft Biden and been in touch with Obama donors to try to make that path happen.,center
VanRiper added his wife, a 2008 Obama bundler who was the Los Angeles chair of Obama’s Gen 44 effort is right there with him: “She’s all in for Biden.”,center
Should Biden decide to run, Obama would be in an almost impossible position himself.,center
Obama seemed confident enough that Biden would skip the race to go short of endorsing Clinton outright, and now people who know the president acknowledge just how tough it would be for him to tell a man he truly considers a brother to follow his heart without giving his own realistic assessment of the height of the mountain he’d have to climb.,center
Add to that the Biden world’s apparent expectation that Obama would be supportive, Obama’s own genuine affection for Clinton and the president having to spend the next eight months tiptoeing around implying either one of them is ahead in the battle for his legacy, and it gets even tougher.,center
“Anyone who has worked there loves Joe Biden.,center
The death of Biden’s older son Beau at the beginning of the summer felt like a personal loss to many former and current Obama staffers, and they know how hard it hit him.,center
Obama was on vacation in Martha’s Vineyard for the last two weeks as the Biden speculation and early exploration ramped up, but senior staffers still haven’t gotten together to talk through what a candidacy would actually mean, both in terms of internal logistics and the political navigation.,center
They anxiously watched her struggling during the press conference about her private email server last week, and the combination of that and Biden floating out there has them thinking.,center
Bring up Biden with many current and former Obama staffers, and conversation stops.,center
But a number of Obama veterans say confidently that there’d be a heavy dose of Obama alumni who’d show up for a Biden campaign.,center
“I could imagine a lot of hands going up and saying, ‘I love Joe Biden, I’ll do it,’” said another former Obama campaign official.,center
“You’ve got a lot of people who like being the underdog, and that’s how Joe Biden would enter the race, and that’s really appealing.”,center
But, “you add Joe Biden, who they love to the mix… That’s a lot of experienced people that might be slightly outdated, but not really.”,center
That’s already begun to take shape.,center
Biden’s looking more appealing than Sen.,center
The United States pledged an extra $190 million in aid to Ukraine Monday, but Vice President Joe Biden warned that Kiev has just “one more chance” to root out corruption or lose the funding.,center
Biden held talks with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, pledging support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression and urging the country’s leaders to continue on the path to reform.,center
“The Ukrainian people cannot once again have their hopes dashed based on corruption,” Biden said.,center
Biden made it clear that the U.S. “stands firmly with the people of Ukraine in the face of continued – and I emphasize continued – aggression from Russia and Russian-backed separatists.”,center
U.S. President Joe Biden wants to reverse his predecessor Donald Trump's trade war with Europe but the transatlantic tariff showdown could be about to get a whole lot worse before it gets better.,center
While the Airbus-Boeing dispute is a long-running sore, Biden's more imminent problem is that there is another hefty tranche of EU duties coming.,center
While both the EU and U.S. have said they would like to avoid that escalation, there is no immediate way out of this crunch because Biden faces internal pressure from steelmakers, unions and some parts of his party to maintain the steel tariffs.,center
Biden's challenge is that removing Trump's steel tariffs would open him up to accusations from industry and unions that he is weaker on trade enforcement than Republicans.,center
One reason Biden defeated Trump in November was that he won back some of the blue-collar voters who abandoned Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.,center
Similarly, in Brussels, there is little appetite to stop the tariff hike unless Biden removes the tariffs.,center
And I think what President Biden has said is we’re going to have a whole of government review of all of these policies and decide what it makes sense to maintain.”,center
Biden's nominee for U.S. trade representative, Katherine Tai, said last week that while she understood the pain coming her country's way in June, she also understood the need to maintain a strong U.S. steel industry.,center
The U.S. steel industry says there’s no reason for the Biden administration to be scared by the EU threat of escalation, arguing that the EU's retaliation was illegal.,center
DUBLIN — Laurita Blewitt knows how deep Joe Biden’s Irish roots run.,center
Today, a pop-art mural of a beaming Biden greets visitors to Ballina, one sign of growing excitement here that the United States might soon get its most Irish-American president since John F.,center
While President Donald Trump’s only apparent tie to Ireland is his ownership of an oceanside golf resort in County Clare, Biden for decades has tied his identity to Ireland.,center
While President Donald Trump’s only apparent tie to Ireland is his ownership of an oceanside golf resort in County Clare, Biden for decades has tied his identity to Ireland.,center
In 1987, before his first failed presidential run, Biden gave a lengthy interview to Irish America magazine.,center
“My grandmother used to say: ‘Remember, Joey Biden, the best drop of blood in you is Irish.’”,center
At that time, Biden didn’t have a full grasp of his Irish ancestry.,center
Among them was 18-year-old Patrick, Biden’s great-great-grandfather, who settled in Scranton.,center

This month activists from a new group, Irish 4 Biden, traveled to the Cooley Peninsula to launch their campaign urging Irish people to telephone their U.S. relatives with pro-Biden messages.,center
One of the locals, Eamon Thornton, recalled meeting Biden during his 2016 trip, when he visited the Kilwirra cemetery overlooking the Irish Sea where dozens of local Finnegans are buried.,center
I wouldn’t see the difference,” said Gerry Finnegan, 70, a third cousin of Biden and a retired miner who spent much of his life in Canada, Zambia and Indonesia but is now back living within a mile of Biden ancestral turf.,center
In 2016, Gerry Finnegan sat beside the then-vice president on a barstool in his local pub, Lily Finnegan’s, showing him old family photos — some of which Biden said he’d seen before from his own household albums.,center

Asked if he’d like to visit the White House if Biden wins, Finnegan sounded similarly nonplussed.,center
Biden particularly bonded with her mother Christina, who was suffering from cancer — much like his own mother and son Beau, who had died of brain cancer only the year before.,center
Biden became a behind-the-scenes backer that day of local efforts to build a hospice for cancer patients.,center
Laurita Blewitt was invited to the White House the following January, when Biden received a Presidential Medal of Freedom from Obama.,center
After the ceremony, Biden took her aside and wrote a personal note to her mother.,center
When Biden visited her mother, “he talked in great detail about her treatment, obviously reflecting his own terrible experience with the disease.,center
Biden sent his condolences.,center

But he still remembers you and takes the time to connect,” said Laurita Blewitt, who also travelled in February to Nevada to canvas door to door for Biden during the Democratic primary.,center
After Laurita’s brother Joe, a local plumber, added a pro-Biden message to his work van — “Joe Biden for the White House and Joe Blewitt for your house!” — a Twitter image of it gained traction.,center
CORRECTION: This article was changed to correct a reference to Biden’s visit to County Mayo and to correct the reference to the year Biden visited Ballina in a picture caption.,center
LONDON — Joe Biden secretly confessed that his family hails from England rather than Ireland, according to an eyebrow-raising claim from former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.,center
Johnson writes: “He disarmed me completely by saying that his family origins were not really Irish at all, and that the Bidens were an old seafaring family from Kent (which seems plausible, since -den is a common Kentish termination).,center
Biden has long celebrated his links to the Republic of Ireland, with family ancestry in Mayo and Louth dating back more than 150 years.,center
During a visit to Ireland in April 2023, Biden said: “Coming here feels like coming home.”,center
“One question I definitely don’t need clarity from is that Joe Biden considers himself Irish,” Harris said.,center
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán traveled to Florida on Friday to visit Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, in a meeting blasted by U.S. President Joe Biden.,center
Biden said of Trump: “You know who he’s meeting with today down in Mar-a-Lago?,center
“I see a future where we defend democracy, not diminish it,” Biden added, during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania on Friday.,center
In Joe Biden, a lifelong transatlanticist with strong links to many of Europe’s most important leaders, including Germany’s Angela Merkel, Europe has the next best thing to one of its own in the White House.,center
After the trauma of the Trump years, many European decision-makers will see the Biden presidency as a golden opportunity not just to repair the transatlantic alliance but to renew and redefine it for the coming decades.,center
Not that Biden would be an easy partner.,center
Whatever his sympathies for Europe, Biden, like Barack Obama before him, will make it clear that the Europeans need to stop talking and start doing if they want an equal partnership with the U.S. and help avoid a return to Trumpism four years from now.,center
Here’s what a Biden reset with Europe might look like across a range of issues.,center
While that tone will get friendlier, the Biden administration is unlikely to return to the status quo ante overnight.,center
That means that while it might be easier to seal a trade arrangement with the Biden administration, it won’t be an easy negotiation, especially considering that the U.S. trade deficit with Europe has ballooned to over $170 billion.,center
That said, Biden could open the door to renewing a transatlantic free trade agreement.,center
Biden’s victory came too late to stop the U.S. from leaving the Paris climate deal, but that doesn’t mean that he can’t reenter it as soon as he takes office.,center
It’s an issue that Biden has made clear he takes seriously, going as far as to signal during the campaign that he sees the U.S. phasing out its reliance on oil and gas over the long term.,center
Bottom line: Biden and Europe see eye-to-eye on climate policy.,center
American-Chinese relations are on the rocks, a state of affairs unlikely to change under Biden.,center
Biden will push Berlin and Europe’s other foot-draggers to join a U.S.-led coalition of democracies to try to halt China’s growing influence on the international scene.,center
Bottom line: In the face of growing public unease over China’s crackdown in Hong Kong and its use of concentration camps to intimidate its Muslim population, Biden’s Washington is likely to prevail.,center
The pledge NATO countries made in 2014 to move toward spending 2 percent of GDP on defense will remain on the agenda under Biden — even if he’s bound to be less nasty than Trump was about reminding Europeans that many countries (chiefly Germany) haven’t been pulling their weight.,center
Biden will also make clear that with the U.S. shifting its attention to China, Europe is going to have to lead the effort on the Continent to counter Russian and Chinese attempts to establish a foothold.,center
While Biden has been vocal in stressing the necessity of confronting Russian aggression, he sees China as the long-term threat.,center
That could make it more difficult for Biden to flip a switch to reverse Trump’s decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal, especially if doing so threatened the recent improvement.,center
While the EU, which regards the deal as one of its great diplomatic achievements, has clung to the pact and is anticipating a U.S. return under Biden, it could be a tough sell in the U.S., even among Democrats.,center
Bottom line: Biden will probably attempt some form of rapprochement with Iran, but a full return to the nuclear deal is unlikely.,center
Behind the scenes, the Biden administration was urging Benjamin Netanyahu to delay launching the offensive — a bid to run the clock, hoping the passing of time might lead Israel to scale back its military plans.,center
Characteristically, U.S. President Joe Biden has been inconsistent, trying to have it all ways.,center
Two weeks ago, when asked what the chances were for a cease-fire in Gaza, Biden was in warrior mode and dismissive.,center
But less than a week later, while in Nantucket, Massachusetts for Thanksgiving, that was all forgotten and Biden struck a different chord saying “the chances are real” that the pause could open the door to a longer cease-fire.,center
Admittedly, Biden hasn’t talked yet of a permanent cease-fire and he’s linked any truces to the release of hostages.,center
But the change in the mood music was striking and has been noted in Israel, where there’s rising anxiety that the Biden administration is making electoral calculations swayed by progressive Democrats, Arab leaders and Europeans.,center
Politicians across the ideological spectrum in Israel are always careful to praise Biden publicly, but most are suspicious of the U.S. president, noting his inconstancy and his long-established pattern to talk grandiosely but act cautiously.,center
In fact, the quip doing the rounds in Tel Aviv is that “Biden is your best friend, until he isn’t.”,center
Joe Biden’s problem is they’re weak.,center
Even with Biden robustly proclaiming his commitment to NATO, the harsh reality of Europe’s unreadiness could create tensions within the alliance that are even more difficult to smooth over than Trump’s badgering of allies to increase their military spending — something they had all pledged to do at a leaders’ summit in Wales in 2014.,center
In recent days, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has sought to assure the Biden administration that he shares the priority being placed on China, just as he repeatedly sought to assure Trump he was pressing for more spending.,center
Stoltenberg has also stressed that China should be brought into discussions on nuclear arms control, echoing a view widely held among Biden’s security team.,center
“Biden has been much more eloquent, much more diplomatic than Trump has, but the threat perception is so vastly different that I see a huge problem for NATO’s cohesion to be emerging.,center
But even if all allies came around to the U.S. point of view on China, claiming consensus with Biden is cheap and easy compared to preparing European militaries for faraway missions.,center
Instead, they rely on the U.S. for security and are now preparing to exit Afghanistan by September 11, a deadline set by Biden, even as some allies fear what will happen in the country when they leave.,center
Some allies don’t share Biden’s perception of China as a military threat.,center
Biden, at his own news conference, emphasized his support for NATO.,center
Biden noted that the only time Article 5 had been invoked was after the September 11 terror attacks on the U.S. — a point Stoltenberg and European allies often reiterate.,center
But some seem to worry that Biden will be too soft on the alliance — including Macron, who has pushed for better political cohesion among allies, and also demanded recognition of Europe’s broader efforts to develop so-called strategic autonomy, the push to build up capabilities on the Continent.,center
The report said Biden should instead encourage European military integration, pushing allies to cooperate so they can do more to protect themselves, rather than just pressing them to spend more on their individual national forces, which creates waste and inefficiencies.,center
While negotiations on the new body are still ongoing, U.S. President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen plan to announce details of the project when they meet in Brussels on June 15.,center
Biden and his EU counterparts "will focus on aligning our approaches to trade and technology so that democracies and not anyone else, not China or other autocracies, are writing the rules for trade and technology for the 21st century," Jake Sullivan, the White House's national security adviser, told reporters this week.,center
In a round of phone calls with leaders in Brussels, U.S. President-elect Joe Biden spoke Monday with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel, who extended congratulations for his victory over Donald Trump.,center
Michel invited Biden to Brussels to attend a meeting with EU heads of state and government.,center
Biden also spoke to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.,center
“Great to speak with President-elect @JoeBiden,” von der Leyen tweeted after their phone conversation.,center
Michel spoke to Biden for approximately 20 minutes.,center
He welcomed the strong commitment of the President-elect Biden to America’s allies and his support for European cooperation.”,center
He also invited Biden to meet with the EU’s 27 heads of state and government in Brussels next year, and urged renewed cooperation in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, pushing for economic recovery, combatting climate change and promoting security and multilateralism.,center
During their conversation, Michel specifically thanked Biden for joining with other U.S. officials, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in standing with Ireland to insist that the U.K. fully implement the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.,center
Stoltenberg said he had also offered congratulations and told Biden he looked forward to planning the next NATO leaders’ summit in 2021.,center
And with Joe Biden officially launching his re-election campaign last week, the U.S. president is now one step closer to facing voters within months of his EU counterpart, Ursula von der Leyen, who is still deciding whether to seek her own second term atop the European Commission.,center
A defeated Biden could mean a return of Donald Trump, who as president launched a trade war with Europe, openly questioned multilateralism and cast the European Union as a foe.,center
And a departing von der Leyen would deprive a re-elected Biden of a resolute EU ally on touchy subjects like sanctioning Russia and keeping China at bay.,center
“We are fortunate to have European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President Biden where they are today,” Representative Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told POLITICO.,center
The arrival of Biden, a committed transatlanticist, to the White House in 2021 was greeted with barely-contained relief in Brussels.,center
The EU was still reeling from the roller-coaster Trump years and it seemed inevitable that things could only get better with the pro-EU Biden in the White House.,center
“Part of that is down to the strong relationship between Biden and von der Leyen, which has allowed the sides to manage through any challenges in the relationship.”,center
Part of this is due to a meeting of minds between von der Leyen, the 64-year-old former German defense minister, and Biden the 46th U.S. president, who was intimately acquainted with Ukraine policy following his stint as vice president during the Obama administration.,center
At a critical Oval Office meeting in November of that year, Biden, who had just come from a briefing by national security and intelligence officials about the buildup of Russian battalions near the Ukraine border, sounded the alarm to von der Leyen.,center
Similarly, a plan to remove Trump-era steel and aluminum tariffs on the EU still remains unresolved more than two years into the Biden presidency.,center
But the biggest strain on relations was Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.,center
Von der Leyen’s perceived closeness to Biden has ruffled some feathers.,center
For Gardner, the former U.S. ambassador, it is von der Leyen’s position on China that is one of the closest indications of the strength of the relationship between the Biden administration and the European Commission.,center
As the United States sounds the warning bell about Beijing’s geopolitical ambitions, particularly when it comes to Taiwan, Biden may discover he needs that supportive voice on China that von der Leyen offers.,center
Given the resistance by some EU figures — not least Macron — to America’s world-view in Asia, Biden may need all the support he can get.,center
That’s the simple rule for European power players looking for entrée to the new U.S. presidential administration should Joe Biden win the election on Tuesday.,center
is Anthony Gardner, the former U.S. ambassador to the EU, who is now based in London and has served as the Biden campaign’s point-main in Europe.,center
is Antony Blinken, a former deputy national security adviser and deputy secretary of state who has been one of Biden’s closest advisers for two decades.,center
The two Tonys are emblematic of the resuscitation and return of the traditional U.S. foreign policy establishment that is expected if Biden becomes president.,center
Blinken is much-discussed as likely to become Biden’s national security adviser.,center
But beyond the return to normalcy, Biden will face a critical choice even before he is sworn into office: between Democrats who crave a resumption of the policies of former President Barack Obama and those who want to correct Obama’s missteps — including some glaring failures in Syria or on Russia relations — and to forge a new U.S. foreign policy doctrine for the 21st century.,center
Where Biden stands will quickly be evident in how he builds his Cabinet and fills senior posts.,center
Biden’s inner circle, led by Blinken, aged 58, is a generation younger than their boss, who will turn 78 next month.,center
Blinken and McKeon worked for Biden for many years as top aides on the Senate foreign relations committee; Haines also briefly worked on the committee when Biden was chairman.,center
Blinken, Sullivan, Carpenter, McKeon and Smith all worked in Biden’s vice presidential office.,center
And Carpenter and McKeon have run the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement at the University of Pennsylvania, an institute created after Biden left office in 2017.,center
Then there’s the larger foreign policy establishment, in which Biden has spent most of his career.,center
“Biden and his team will have to find some way to reshape U.S. foreign policy and revive the United States’ sense of its purpose in the world,” he wrote.,center
A Biden victory in November would offer the temptation of seeking to restore the United States’ post–Cold War image of itself as a virtuous hegemon.,center
There is no doubt Biden and his team would mark a return to more traditional foreign policy — renewed support for multilateral organizations and long-held alliances; less tweeting and courting of strongmen like Russian President Vladimir Putin or Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.,center
“There’s a choice that the Biden folks are going to have to make,” said one member of the Blob, who has advised the campaign and spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing chances of a job.,center
“People don’t quite know — what is Biden trying to do?” the campaign adviser said.,center
While much attention has focused on a debate between progressive Democrats like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren and centrists like Biden, Wright focuses on a more nuanced split between the centrists, which Biden will have to referee.,center
Contenders for secretary of state include Senator Chris Coons, who currently holds Biden’s old seat from Delaware; Senator Chris Murphy, a relative young and progressive member of the foreign relations committee from Connecticut; Susan Rice, who served as ambassador to the U.N. and national security adviser for Obama; and Samantha Power, another former U.N. envoy.,center
Compared with Trump, who waged a war against the alleged “deep state” throughout his presidency, Biden will certainly put greater faith in all of his advisers, and especially in the U.S. foreign policy and intelligence communities.,center
Indeed, Obama chose Biden as his running mate largely because of Biden’s foreign policy experience.,center
While the Tonys have Biden’s ear when needed, nearly anyone who is anyone in EU foreign policy knows Joe or, at least, has met him.,center
“He has been in the Senate longer than I can remember, and during my ambassadorial too, whenever we had guests from Germany, members of the Bundestag or ministers, Senator Biden was always available to meet with somebody,” Ischinger said.,center
To patch up that friendship, Biden could turn to Karen Donfried, former senior director for European affairs on Obama’s National Security Council.,center
By appointing familiar faces, Biden would send an important reassuring signal, said Susan Corke, director of the bipartisan Transatlantic Democracy Working Group at the German Marshall Fund.,center
One test for Biden will be if he puts the brakes on the long-standing American tradition of rewarding major campaign donors with plum ambassadorships.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden warned Thursday that there was a “very high” threat that Russia would launch an invasion of Ukraine “within the next several days” as the Kremlin sent Washington a memo complaining bitterly its demands for security guarantees were being ignored, and again threatening a “military-technical” response.,center
Biden, speaking in Washington, flatly contradicted Moscow’s assertions in recent days that it had begun pulling back forces from Ukraine’s borders.,center
“They have not moved any of their troops out,” Biden said.,center
Some Russian officials also ridiculed the prior warnings from Western leaders, including from Biden, who had told allies that an attack might begin as soon as February 16.,center
Papua New Guinea’s Prime Minister James Marape clapped back at Joe Biden, after the U.S. president implied his uncle — an American World War II pilot — had been eaten by “cannibals” after crashing on the Pacific island.,center
“President Biden’s remarks may have been a slip of the tongue; however, my country does not deserve to be labeled as such,” Marape said in a statement, several media outlets reported Monday.,center
Biden made the controversial remark last week, when recounting the death of his uncle Ambrose Finnegan, an Army Air Corps member who flew reconnaissance missions during World War II.,center
“And he got shot down in New Guinea, and they never found the body because there used to be — there were a lot of cannibals, for real, in that part of New Guinea,” Biden said while speaking at the United Steelworkers headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.,center
Defending his country, Marape also urged Biden to “clean up” the remains of World War II casualties “scattered all over” Papua New Guinea.,center
“Perhaps, given President Biden’s comments and the strong reaction from PNG and other parts of the world, it is time for the USA to find as many remains of World War II in PNG as possible, including those of servicemen who lost their lives like Ambrose Finnegan,” he said.,center
Biden has repeatedly slipped up with memory lapses and gaffes as he runs against Republican candidate Donald Trump for a second term in the White House.,center
So eight months out from polling day in America, it’s hardly surprising that domestic reaction to Thursday’s State of the Union speech will be dominated by arguments over the economy, drug prices and the frailty of U.S. President Joe Biden, 82 this November.,center
Around a dozen senior figures from across the Continent who spoke to POLITICO all urged Biden to use his State of the Union address to push Congress to finally pass his $60 billion military aid package for Kyiv.,center
“That will be the most important thing to look out for” in Biden’s speech, an EU diplomat agreed, “even though we know that the problem is not with him.”,center
Another European diplomat said while ambassadors recognize the focus of the speech will be domestic, they will be “watching closely for President Biden making the case for the importance of American leadership in the world.” Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of recently deceased Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, was invited but was unable to attend.,center
Europe’s political elites largely hope Biden can cast off concerns about his age and physical frailty, and project strength.,center
Christopher Weissberg, an MP in French President Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance party, said he hoped Biden will “build a central bloc and project himself as the last bastion for U.S. democracy.” He added: “We hope for a political speech that sets out that behind the stakes in Ukraine, it’s our civilization that is at stake.”,center
European politicians and officials are increasingly reluctant to express public support for Biden’s reelection bid — but most foreign policy analysts agree that behind the scenes, the vast majority in Europe are desperately hoping Trump does not return.,center
Sophia Gaston, head of foreign policy and U.K. resilience at the London-based Policy Exchange think tank, said: “There’s no doubt Whitehall will be praying for a strong showing from Biden in the face of an ascendant Trump.,center
“Britain will want to see a tactical and sharp-eyed Biden … We will want to see the president making a convincing case for American internationalism.”,center
Ex-Tory Minister Tim Loughton told the BBC that Biden “frankly needs to read the room — it’s time to go home to the cocoa and slippers” and give way to a “strong, credible, moderate” candidate for president.,center
One Labour shadow minister said Biden should use his speech to “lay down a strong challenge to Congress.” They added: “There are Republicans who want to pass this and people who believe it would pass if it can just get to the floor.”,center
“Everyone who talks about support for Ukraine under Trump is missing the point that the big focus is China, for both Biden and Trump,” they said.,center
The first EU diplomat quoted above said ambassadors would be hoping Biden mentions the Middle East war — as well as China and global trade — in Thursday’s speech.,center
Except for the odd populist leader here or there, most of Europe is quietly hoping Democratic nominee Joe Biden will win next week’s U.S. presidential election and usher in a return to more “normal” transatlantic politics.,center
A Biden presidency might steady the ship, but another Donald Trump victory could do something more valuable for Macron’s agenda: Give Europe another “wake-up” shake and convince leaders to push ahead with Paris’ plan for a sovereign and strategically autonomous Europe.,center
If Biden wins, many European governments will rush back into the American camp.”,center
According to a recent YouGov poll, a majority of French people who had an opinion on who is the better candidate — 84 percent — want a Biden victory.,center
And according to people at the Elysée with knowledge of his thinking, Macron has come to a similar conclusion: A Biden presidency carries more benefits than the potential momentum toward European autonomy unleashed by the prospect of another Trump victory.,center
Macron’s preference for Biden over Trump is partly personal.,center
There is another reason why Macron would vote for Biden if he could.,center
With Biden as president, Macron could also expect and welcome a much more predictable and constructive U.S.-EU relationship on trade, NATO, Iran, the Middle East and above all on climate change.,center
Macron wants to give the last 18 months of his mandate a green tinge, and the U.S. re-entering the Paris climate agreement under Biden would be welcome news.,center
And yet people close to Macron acknowledge that the retired ambassador has a point: There is a  risk that other EU countries — starting with a post-Merkel Germany — will take a Biden victory as an excuse to fall back into a lazy, and ultimately self-defeating, pattern of dependency on the U.S. military shield.,center
In a sense, Macron’s preference for a Biden administration is an admission that the French European sovereignty agenda is a long haul.,center
Throughout it all, the U.S. has stayed noticeably mum on the subject, merely indicating President Joe Biden hasn’t settled on a candidate and effusively praising Stoltenberg’s work.,center
Yet Biden can’t sit on the fence forever.,center
Frederiksen met with Biden at the White House last week, turbocharging speculation about her future.,center
Asked last week if it’s time for a British secretary-general, Biden was lukewarm.,center
Russian ships are racing to finish the contentious Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea, but so far U.S. President Joe Biden is resisting pressure to slap sanctions on the project.,center
Speaking at Friday's Munich Security Conference, Biden didn't mention the pipeline, though he did warn that Russian President Vladimir Putin "seeks to weaken the European project and our NATO alliance.,center
But for now Biden is not following demands from members of the U.S. Congress to impose additional measures against the Gazprom-backed pipeline.,center
That doesn't mean that Biden has shifted from Washington's skepticism of the project.,center
The effort involves a fleet of at least seven Russian vessels supplying the Fortuna, a pipelaying ship outgoing President Donald Trump hit with U.S. sanctions the day before Biden's inauguration.,center
Despite the pressure for Biden to act, there's probably still time for Washington to staff up — State Department positions that would be key in negotiations have yet to be filled — and make up its mind.,center
BALI, LONDON — Rishi Sunak and Joe Biden had plenty of things to talk about at the G20 — but a coveted post-Brexit U.K.-U.S. trade deal wasn’t one of them.,center
The U.K. has long hoped to land a comprehensive free-trade deal with the U.S., but the prospects of doing so have faded under the Biden administration and the two sides are now looking at other ways to boost business between the two countries.,center
“We didn't discuss the trade deal in particular, but we did discuss our economic partnership,” Sunak told POLITICO following a meeting with Biden at the G20 Leaders' Summit in Bali, Indonesia, Wednesday.,center
Joe Biden’s presidential campaign is severely restricting its staffers’ and volunteers’ contacts with foreign officials to avoid even the perception of outside interference with this year’s election — a move it attributes to a “poisonous environment” created by President Donald Trump.,center
It could be a tough policy to enforce given that the Biden campaign’s foreign policy apparatus has expanded to more than 1,000 people, and that foreign governments are increasingly eager to establish connections with the campaign.,center
Trump was impeached late last year over his attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, though he was later acquitted in the Senate.,center
“Because of this poisonous environment created by the president, and so that there is no confusion as to whether or not we are inviting any assistance from foreign governments … our campaign has refrained from engaging in substantive conversations with foreign government officials, and would only do so under conditions that ensure transparency,” Antony Blinken, a senior adviser to Biden, said in a statement to POLITICO.,center
Blinken accused Trump of having “debased” the office of the presidency by “even begging foreign governments to shore up his re-election campaign.” Trump has denied that allegation, though he has publicly called on the Chinese and Ukrainian governments to investigate the Bidens.,center
Biden has for years “forcefully argued against any campaign” accepting foreign assistance, Blinken said.,center
The Biden campaign said it did not foresee any circumstance in which it would engage in any substantive interaction with a foreign official.,center
The Biden campaign’s choice is in many ways more symbolic than anything.,center
Biden has longstanding relationships with an array of foreign officials, including heads of state, dating back to his years in Congress as well as his time as Barack Obama’s vice president.,center
Some of his top foreign policy advisers – among them Blinken, a former deputy secretary of State; Jake Sullivan, a former top State Department official; and Julie Smith, who advised Biden at the White House – are veteran Washington figures with massive Rolodexes who have published essays and other position papers that speak to what a Biden presidency might look like.,center
And because Biden and many of his advisers served in the Obama administration, their negotiating styles as well as their views on plenty of foreign policy issues also are well-known.,center
The Biden campaign’s decision to restrict contacts with foreign officials was quietly made within a couple of months after the former vice president formally launched his White House run in April 2019.,center
In 2020, even before effectively wrapping up the primary, Biden had already won the allegiance of much of the Democratic foreign policy establishment, with many former Obama appointees flocking to his campaign.,center
According to two people on calls with the Biden campaign during which the issue was discussed in the spring, at least 800 foreign policy and national security hands are on the Biden team.,center
“A number of our over 1,000 informal volunteers, in the course of their own professional work, deal with foreign government officials – but they have been given strict guidance to never interact with any such officials on behalf of the campaign and not to share anything about their advice to the campaign or other substantive campaign matters,” a Biden aide said.,center
The Biden campaign has set up some 20 committees to tackle foreign policy and national security issues, such as relations with China, the two people said.,center
Brussels delivered a sharp message on Wednesday that U.S. President Joe Biden should "walk the talk" at a summit next week and take concrete action to unwind tariffs that poisoned transatlantic relations under Donald Trump.,center
A summit in Brussels on June 15 between Biden and top EU officials is being styled as a prime opportunity to reset EU-U.S. ties, but the European Commission's trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis is still bristling that Biden has kept in place several measures imposed by Trump that ignited a transatlantic trade war.,center
The EU has been pushing for a long-term détente with the U.S. since Biden's election.,center
European Commission president’s close relationship with Joe Biden could be a liability.,center
LONDON — Keir Starmer really doesn’t want to end up like Joe Biden.,center
But they have since noted that Biden’s economic successes received short shrift from voters — and now want to ground their growth aims in the everyday.,center
But despite the talk of secure borders, Starmer is not expected to set out a target on migration — another issue that bedeviled Biden.,center
“Biden did have the top economic growth in the G7 and yet voters booted him out because [they] didn’t feel the impact themselves,” the official said.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration believed beefing up Australia’s military capabilities to contend with an increasingly adversarial China was more critical to U.S. interests than French feelings, or even sound relations with Paris.,center
And in inking that choice, even at the risk of damaging a long-time alliance, Biden is telling European allies to close ranks on China — or the U.S. will find other partners who will.,center
In Europe, Washington’s decisions are — not surprisingly — seen as an affront, especially coming from Biden, who repeatedly pledged to repair the damage done to traditional U.S. alliances by a combative Trump presidency.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday pitched himself as the EU's savior from its Russian energy addiction — but arranging a rapid increase in the amount of liquefied natural gas sailing to Europe won't be easy.,center
“We’re coming together to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian energy,” Biden said at a joint press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as the two leaders worked on how to punish Russia for invading Ukraine.,center
On Friday, Biden said it also meant the EU fast-tracking building permits for new LNG import terminals and pushing European countries to show there is sufficient demand for American gas through 2030.,center
“To accomplish this, the European Commission is going to work with the member states to store gas across the Continent [and] to build more infrastructure to receive LNG," Biden said.,center
The White House is on the defensive after political divisions explode following Biden’s trip to the region.,center
Vice President Joe Biden landed in Baghdad last week with his aides optimistically declaring that Iraq’s political tumult had “trended in a more stabilizing direction.”,center
At the same time, the situation underscores the limited influence U.S. officials — even one as deeply versed in Iraq as Biden — have over the politics of the country America invaded 13 years ago.,center
Obama administration officials on Monday defended the optimistic overtures from Biden and his aides.,center
And during Monday’s media briefing, White House press secretary Josh Earnest insisted there was no conflict between Biden’s rosy words and the situation on the ground.,center
The chaotic images created a messaging headache for Biden, who has long been the administration’s point person for Iraq, but whose visit last Thursday was his first to the country in more than four years.,center
Biden met al-Abadi and other Iraqi leaders and urged the country to unite against the Islamic State.,center
Europe's trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis has fired a warning shot at new U.S. President Joe Biden over his plans to press U.S. authorities to "Buy American.",center
U.S. President Joe Biden has already started tightening U.S. rules that force federal authorities to buy from American suppliers.,center
While signaling the EU was worried about Washington's steps, Dombrovskis stopped just short of saying Biden was breaking WTO rules.,center
More generally, the EU trade chief suggested transatlantic relations would be easier with the Biden administration, reiterating that Brussels had already proposed that Europe and America lift their reciprocal tariffs, agree new rules on subsidizing aerospace giants Airbus and Boeing, and work to tackle Chinese overcapacity.,center
"The signals we are receiving from the new Biden administration are broadly speaking encouraging," he said.,center
The White House pushed back Tuesday at the notion that comments from Vice President Joe Biden blasting the Israeli government the previous night represented an attempt to vilify the Middle Eastern ally.,center
“Well I would vigorously disagree with that description of what Vice President Biden said,” press secretary Josh Earnest said in response to a question from Fox News’ Peter Doocy.,center
In a speech to the left-leaning J Street on Monday night in Washington, Biden said the Israeli government at times causes “overwhelming frustration.”,center
“The present course Israel’s on is not one that’s likely to secure its existence as a Jewish, democratic state— and we have to make sure that happens,” Biden said at the gathering.,center
Noting that Biden traveled to Israel last month, Earnest added that during the vice president’s first trip to the country in 2009, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated “unprecedented” cooperation on security matters.,center
Earnest also dismissed the issue of Biden’s timing, after it was pointed out that the comments came hours after the bombing of a bus in Jerusalem that local authorities called a terrorist attack.,center
‘I cannot honestly answer why President Biden came to that conclusion,’ says chief medical officer of European Medicines Agency.,center
The European Medicines Agency’s top scientist stated Tuesday that the pandemic is “ongoing” after U.S. President Joe Biden declared that the health crisis was over.,center
“I cannot honestly answer why President Biden came to that conclusion,” the regulator’s chief medical officer, Steffen Thirstrup, told journalists during a briefing.,center
In an interview that aired late on Sunday in the U.S., Biden declared: “The pandemic is over,” adding: “We still have a problem with COVID.,center
The off-the-cuff remark caught Biden's own senior health officials by surprise.,center
BERLIN — U.S. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz vowed to maintain support for Ukraine during a highly-symbolic meeting in Berlin on Friday as European leaders face the prospect of a Donald Trump victory in the U.S. election in less than three weeks.,center
“We must sustain our resolve, our effort and our support,” said Biden at the German chancellery.,center
Biden’s visit comes at a time of particular peril for Ukraine as Russian forces in the east of the country make grinding advances in the full-scale war, now entering its third winter.,center
Biden said he and Scholz would discuss efforts “to surge support to Ukraine’s military,” shore up Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, and help Ukraine recover “by unlocking the value” of frozen Russian assets.,center
At the same time, Scholz alluded to the fine line that he and Biden have been walking during the war, providing Ukraine with military aid without going so far as to escalate the conflict.,center
European concerns about a potential Trump victory were exacerbated by comments Trump made in a podcast released this week in which he appeared to blame Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Biden for the war, comments that echo the views of Russian President Vladimir Putin.,center
Joe Biden took office nearly four years ago with a promise to mend America’s relationship with Europe after years of strained ties during the Trump administration.,center
In Berlin on Friday, Biden praised Germany for the reaching the target.,center
Earlier in the day, German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier awarded Biden with the highest “Order of Merit.”,center
Biden also praised German leaders for providing more military aid to Ukraine than any other European country, and second only to the U.S.,center
But behind closed doors, Biden was expected to urge German leaders to be prepared to do more.,center
Later in the day, French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer are scheduled to join Biden and Scholz for a so-called “quad meeting” in which the leaders are set to discuss the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.,center
Both Biden and Scholz suggested the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli forces could open up an opportunity for a ceasefire in Gaza.,center
“The death of the leader of Hamas represents a moment of justice,” said Biden.,center
But according to the U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, the more important point was that U.S. President Joe Biden never told Macron to jump in a lake.,center
Describing the Biden administration’s response to the French dismay, Sullivan said: “It was to act decisively, and I believe quite effectively in engaging directly with the French over a course of a very short period of time to establish a conversation between the two presidents, produce a joint statement, generate the return of their ambassador, and then generate a sustained diplomatic conversation.”,center
During a roundtable discussion with reporters, Sullivan was challenged several times over allegations by European allies that Washington does not consult sufficiently, and that Biden specifically disregarded misgivings over the plan to withdraw from Afghanistan.,center
On Afghanistan, Sullivan insisted that there had been sufficient consultation but that the Europeans simply disagreed with Biden’s decision.,center
Allies at NATO may remember that sequence of events somewhat differently, with Blinken arriving in Brussels to give them very short notice of Biden’s impending withdrawal plan.,center
Overall, he insisted that the Biden administration was committed to working closely with partners, and he even cited examples of when EU leaders were right and Washington was wrong — at least when Washington was controlled by Trump and when the EU was agreeing with decisions that Biden, Sullivan and others had a hand in during the Obama administration.,center
Sullivan also said that Biden was truly willing to support greater European military and defense capabilities, a key point in the joint statement with Macron aimed at smoothing over the AUKUS dispute.,center
And that’s the spirit that the Biden administration is bringing on that issue.”,center
Provisional itinerary seen by POLITICO has Biden starting in Northern Ireland and finishing with family visit to cousins in County Mayo.,center
DUBLIN — U.S. President Joe Biden will pay a five-day visit to both parts of Ireland next month to mark the 25th anniversary of the U.S.-brokered Good Friday peace accord, according to a provisional Irish government itinerary seen by POLITICO.,center
With Irish roots on both sides of his family tree, Biden has long taken an interest in brokering and maintaining peace in Northern Ireland.,center
According to two Irish government officials involved in planning the Biden visit itinerary,  the president will start his stay overnight at Hillsborough Castle, southwest of Belfast, the official residence for visiting British royalty, as a guest of the U.K.’s Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris.,center
Nonetheless, assembly members from all parties including the DUP will be invited to meet Biden there.,center
This would allow Biden to pay a visit to one side of his Irish family tree, the Finnegans, in County Louth.,center
Biden previously toured the area in 2016 as vice president, when he met distant relatives for the first time and visited the local graveyard.,center
In Dublin, it is not yet confirmed whether Biden will deliver a speech at College Green outside the entrance of Trinity College.,center
Members of Ireland’s national police force, An Garda Síochána, have been told by commanders they cannot go on leave during the week of April 10-16 in anticipation of Biden’s arrival.,center
The final two days of Biden’s visit will focus on the other side of his Irish roots, the Blewitts of County Mayo, on Ireland’s west coast, which he also visited in 2016.,center
White House officials declined to discuss specific dates or any events planned, but did confirm that Biden would travel to Ireland “right after Easter.” This suggests an April 11 arrival in line with the Irish itinerary.,center
Macron discussed the plan with U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday at the G7 gathering of wealthy democracies in England, before raising it with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Monday at the NATO summit in Brussels.,center
It’s a tactical shift for Macron, adopting a more collective approach that could end up offering a foreign policy win to someone else — Joe Biden.,center
The Biden administration would not say whether it backs France’s latest proposal — and didn’t indicate whether Biden would discuss the plan with Erdoğan or Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Biden is meeting on Wednesday for a day-long summit.,center
Biden officials said the president discussed Libya generally with Erdoğan during a longer-than-expected meeting at the NATO summit on Monday.,center
And Libya is expected to be on the agenda for Biden’s meeting with Putin Wednesday afternoon in Geneva.,center
If Biden emerges from his Putin meeting with some commitment to cooperate on Libya, it could offer the U.S. president a concrete win from a meeting that isn’t expected to produce many.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden is rushing to recruit the EU as an ally against China, but wary Europeans want him to end trade hostilities against them first.,center
Biden would love to use an EU summit in Brussels on Tuesday to show that America and Europe can unite against Beijing in the showdown for technological and trade supremacy in the 21st century.,center
Even if an 11th-hour deal is struck, Europe wants Biden to go further.,center
The problem is that, behind all the smiles expected at the transatlantic lovefest, EU officials are fuming that Biden hasn't ended the trade war initiated by his predecessor Donald Trump, who slapped heavy tariffs on the EU.,center
On the most toxic issue of Trump-era tariffs on steel and aluminum, EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis has urged Biden to "walk the talk" on his trip to Europe and drop the duties.,center
Although such a move would be the decisive signal of U.S. goodwill and could help win EU support for a broader realignment against Beijing, with which Brussels struck a landmark investment deal in December, Biden seems in no hurry to bury that hatchet.,center
That dispute is, however, proving hard to put to bed by the time Biden meets EU Council President Charles Michel and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday.,center
In an effort to conjure up positive news, Biden and von der Leyen will on Tuesday announce the creation of the new Trade and Technology Council body to have a wide-ranging partnership around technology and trade.,center
And if a face-saving deal on aircraft subsidies is made within the set July deadline, it would certainly be a defining moment of Biden's tour.,center
Brussels in May hit the pause button on retaliatory tariffs to find a long-term solution for the global steel overcapacity, but Biden faces internal pressure from steelmakers and unions to maintain them.,center
The Biden administration is eager to secure a political agreement with the EU on how to unlock the issue, hoping to score a win on the problematic area that has been years in the making.,center
The Biden administration has also not made any move to resolve the blockade of the World Trade Organization's court system.,center
But having a common enemy in China may, as Biden hopes, help to strengthen transatlantic bonds.,center
European Commission president’s close relationship with Joe Biden could be a liability.,center
On both sides of the Atlantic there are hopes Truss can help steer the debate on the American right away from isolationism and toward the active international role espoused by both U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and U.S. President Joe Biden.,center
The delegation’s arrival coincides with a stand-off between Biden and Republican lawmakers, who are stalling on a request to send billions more dollars in military aid to Ukraine.,center
Former President Donald Trump, who is widely expected to secure the Republican nomination for next year’s general election — and who polling suggests is ahead of Biden in a series of key battleground states — shares this skeptical view of Ukraine aid.,center
A showdown is expected next week with a potential vote in the Senate on Biden’s $106 billion aid package — $61.4 billion of which is earmarked for Ukraine.,center
One U.K. official said of the delegation: “They bring a more authentic voice to those kind of Republicans who like speaking to people from their own party — they’re not encumbered by government policy, they don’t have to sort of say nice things about the [Biden] administration.,center
Far from being nice about the Biden administration, Truss was quick to explicitly endorse the Republican Party ahead of her trip, writing in the Wall Street Journal that she hoped “a Republican will be returned to the White House in 2024.”,center
U.S. President Joe Biden voiced a strong commitment to European security at a NATO summit on Monday, describing the alliance’s collective defense clause as a “sacred obligation.”,center
If there weren’t one, we’d have to invent one,” Biden, on his first overseas trip as U.S. president, said at a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at the alliance’s headquarters in Brussels.,center
“I just want all of Europe to know that the United States is there,” said Biden, speaking shortly before he and Stoltenberg joined other NATO leaders for a meeting of the alliance’s North Atlantic Council.,center
Biden’s full-throated support for NATO and European security offered a marked contrast to his predecessor, Donald Trump, whose criticism of the alliance left many members wondering whether they could rely on the United States.,center
“Article 5 we take as a sacred obligation,” said Biden, referring to NATO’s collective defense pact.,center
Biden cited Russia and China among challenges facing the alliance.,center
But Biden’s tone was quite different: He said some members have already hit their targets and “others are on the way.”,center
When U.S. President Joe Biden arrives at Windsor Castle on Monday he will renew an acquaintance with King Charles III which stretches back decades.,center
Biden has made a point of stopping off in Britain on his way to this week’s NATO summit in Lithuania to fulfill a first bilateral reception with Charles since he ascended the throne, alongside talks with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in Downing Street.,center
The president missed the king's coronation in May, where the U.S. was represented by First Lady Jill Biden, and chose not to visit Great Britain during his trip to Ireland and Northern Ireland in April.,center
Biden and Charles come from wildly different backgrounds but are of a similar generation — the king is six years Biden's junior — and share a strong commitment to tackling climate change, as well as a deeply-held love of Ireland and Irish culture.,center
Biden, a proud Irish-American, has long made clear privately that he is not the biggest fan of the English monarchy.,center
Biden and Charles will receive a joint briefing from Britain's Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary Grant Shapps and U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry on a trans-Atlantic drive to "accelerate the deployment of literally trillions of dollars" of climate change investment, Kerry told the BBC on Sunday.,center
Biden has sought to reassert the U.S. role in reducing carbon emissions, rejoining the Paris Agreement on taking office and passing the Inflation Reduction Act — his landmark injection of $500 billion into clean energy and green industries.,center
The pair have joined forces on green campaigns before, with TV cameras picking up Biden telling the then-prince at the COP26 climate summit that “we need you badly” in the global drive to lower emissions.,center
A former Irish diplomat said the king “has very clearly maintained the legacy of his mother, in terms of her very positive influence on improving relations,” and agreed that Charles and Biden “have in common their shared and very constructive interest in Ireland.”,center
They added this had been underlined by Charles' engagement with Irish leaders around the time of Queen Elizabeth II's death and again at the coronation, and in Biden’s case with his visits to Belfast and Dublin to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.,center
TEL AVIV — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he intends to press ahead with an invasion of the city of Rafah on the southern border of the Gaza Strip in defiance of United States President Joe Biden, who has warned such an offensive would be a "red line.",center
Netanyahu also directly addressed criticism from Biden, who has said the Israeli leader is “hurting Israel more than helping Israel.”,center
Netanyahu hit back, saying while he didn’t know “exactly what the president meant,” if Biden was saying he was contravening the wishes or interests of Israel, he was “wrong on both counts.”,center
For Biden it’s becoming increasingly important not to alienate the left wing of the Democratic Party in the run-up to the U.S. election in November.,center
Yes: Joe Biden for the most part was crisper, more engaged and engaging in Detroit on Wednesday night than he had been in Miami a month ago.,center
If Biden is the essential variable in the Democratic presidential race — none of the nearly two dozen other candidates can rise much further unless or until Biden is perceived to be in a dying fall — then the most reasonable reaction to the latest two-day pair of long and crowded debates is: So what?,center
Biden’s two debate outings this summer suggest that a politician who has been at this game for decades operates within a predictable and fairly narrow range — at his best, not half-bad; at his worst, pretty bad for a supposed front-runner.,center
Though he was closer to the upper range this time — except for a funny fumbled line at the end when he tried to tell people to support his campaign with a text message — it still seems inconceivable that many undecided voters will move to Biden because they think he is a reliably good debater.,center
“And any time someone tells you you’re going to get something good in 10 years, you should wonder why it takes 10 years” — Joe Biden to Kamala Harris,center
Every candidate other than Biden has a powerful incentive to prove that the debates do matter, and no candidate has a better claim on that case than Senator Kamala Harris, who along with Biden seemed to have an outsize role (as both attacker and attackee) on the debate stage.,center
She proved that her breakout moment in Miami, when she threw Biden off his game by attacking his 1970s collaboration with Southern segregationists to oppose federal busing mandates, was not an anomaly.,center
At least on stylistic grounds she truly is a good debater — fluent, well-prepared, emphatic — and she came determined to throw plenty more chops at Biden and others.,center
What’s more, her fellow debaters paid a compliment to Harris’ new ascendant status, as they joined Biden in skewering her policy plans and her record as prosecutor and attorney general in California.,center
Biden was flanked by Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris | Scott Olson/Getty Images,center
“The senator has had several plans so far,” Biden taunted, seeming to enjoy the chance to return fire at Harris.,center
Speaking of America, Biden said, “So, Mr. President, let’s get something straight: We love it.,center
Responding to criticism on his criminal justice record from Senator Cory Booker, Biden said, “That’s the essence of what my plan, in detail, lays out.,center
Biden and Harris took enough oxygen — 21 minutes of speaking time for him; 17 and a half minutes for her — that other candidates had to be strategic about finding moments to stand out.,center
Booker defended his record in cleaning up Newark and rooting out police corruption during his tenure as Newark mayor from Biden’s darts, and later threw others back when Biden said he couldn’t divulge whether as vice president he had pressed President Barack Obama to change his policy on immigrant deportations.,center
Colorado Senator Michael Bennet, who is well-positioned to carry the centrist banner against more liberal contenders if Biden stumbles, projected more confidence in this debate than he did in the first round in Miami.,center
He chided Harris and others for allowing the argument to reach back to Biden’s school integration record in the 1970s instead of focusing on current problems.,center
It’s impossible to imagine the Joe Biden of the 1970s, or the 1990s, or of this campaign saying something like that.,center
Some politicians try to update their image — the “New Nixon” of 1968 was the most notorious example — but in Biden’s case this year’s model is always pretty much the same.,center
Chancellor praises Biden and doesn’t mention Trump in statement on US election result.,center
BERLIN — Germany and Europe are ready to contribute more to the transatlantic relationship, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Monday following Joe Biden’s U.S. presidential election victory.,center
Merkel, who regularly met with Biden during his eight years as vice president, praised the U.S. president-elect’s “decades of experience in both domestic and foreign policy.”,center
She congratulated Biden on his victory “very warmly.”,center
EU officials attack Joe Biden over sky-high gas prices, weapons sales and trade as Vladimir Putin’s war threatens to destroy Western unity.,center
Top European officials are furious with Joe Biden’s administration and now accuse the Americans of making a fortune from the war, while EU countries suffer.,center
“The rise in gas prices in Europe is caused by Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and Putin's energy war against Europe, period," a spokesperson for Biden's National Security Council said.,center
The biggest point of tension in recent weeks has been Biden’s green subsidies and taxes that Brussels says unfairly tilt trade away from the EU and threaten to destroy European industries.,center
Ministers and diplomats based elsewhere in the bloc voiced frustration at the way Biden’s government simply ignores the impact of its domestic economic policies on European allies.,center
When EU leaders tackled Biden over high U.S. gas prices at the G20 meeting in Bali last week, the American president simply seemed unaware of the issue, according to the senior official quoted above.,center
The growing dispute over Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) — a huge tax, climate and health care package — has put fears over a transatlantic trade war high on the political agenda again.,center
For Biden, the legislation is a historic climate achievement.,center
European Commission president’s close relationship with Joe Biden could be a liability.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden will make his first state visit to France next week after attending a ceremony on the 80th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy.,center
PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron will host U.S. President Joe Biden for a state visit in Paris after D-Day commemorations next week, the French presidency and the White House announced Thursday.,center
The June 8 engagement will be Biden’s first state visit to France and comes ahead of a series of summits including of G-7 and NATO leaders, where Ukraine will likely dominate talks.,center
Biden hosted Macron on a state visit to Washington in 2022.,center
Biden and Macron are also expected to discuss economic, space and nuclear topics as well as climate change.,center
Biden is in no rush to revive the World Trade Organization from the deep freeze that Trump pushed it into.,center
GENEVA — U.S. President Joe Biden declared back in February that "America is back," but it doesn't feel that way in Geneva.,center
But Biden is bringing changes of style rather than substance.,center
"The Biden-Harris administration believes that trade — and the WTO — can be a force for good.",center
The approach that the Trump and Biden administration has taken so far have gotten nowhere, let’s be honest about that," he added.,center
Although "America First" is no longer officially the U.S. mantra since Biden stepped in, “Buy American” and nationalist sentiments are still taking a toll on U.S. trade policy.,center
There’s "strong nationalist resentment in the U.S. that Biden can’t ignore," he added.,center
The administration isn’t willing to burn its political capital in Congress on trade and WTO reform at a time when Biden is focused on countering China and on his landmark Build Back Better legislation.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden is arriving in Brussels on Wednesday night for a bumper session of NATO, EU and G7 meetings but Russian agents in Europe’s city of spies are keeping their heads down.,center
European Commission president’s close relationship with Joe Biden could be a liability.,center
“We will fight with our fingernails if we have to,” a defiant Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his war Cabinet after a tense phone call with U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday.,center
During the call, Biden had warned that the U.S. would withhold weapons shipments if Israel launched a long-delayed ground offensive on Rafah — the last major Hamas stronghold in Gaza.,center
Olmert had expected Biden would do something similar, slowing supplies without making a formal announcement in a bid to pressure Netanyahu.,center
They assumed Biden would eventually make an electoral calculation and be swayed by progressive Democrats, Arab leaders and Europeans to start conditioning weapon transfers.,center
But, like Olmert, they also thought Biden would refrain from making a formal statement — that the pressure would be much more covert, abiding by the long-running principle of pulling no surprises and not allowing too much daylight between the U.S. and Israel.,center
However, they miscalculated the depth of Biden’s personal frustration with Netanyahu, as well as his growing electoral worries amid rising fears that the war in Gaza could lose him crucial young voters in the upcoming election.,center
A U.S. official, who asked to not to be identified so he could speak freely, told POLITICO the president is becoming “apoplectic with rage towards Netanyahu.” “Biden can’t understand why Bibi doesn’t appreciate that he’s bending over backwards to help Israel.,center
However, the official also mentioned that Biden’s calculations aren’t purely wrapped up in U.S. politics.,center
He said Biden’s frustrated with Netanyahu for not prioritizing a deal with Hamas to get remaining hostages out of Gaza, and the president believes that by disregarding the wishes of Arab leaders, who are desperate for the Gaza war to end, the Israeli leader is squandering a diplomatic opportunity to build an effective international coalition against the mullahs in Tehran.,center
But Biden’s decision to go public about potentially withholding offensive weapons has now prompted the fury of Israel’s right wing, putting Netanyahu in an awkward spot.,center
Biden may be struggling with his own domestic political challenges, but Netanyahu has his fair share of troubles as well.,center
“We hope it doesn’t come to the Biden administration cutting off weapons transfers,” he said.,center
While American Democrats, who have long been urging for conditions to be placed on arms transfers, argue that Biden’s been underestimating Washington’s clout, the history of U.S.-Israeli relations suggests his leverage may not be as great as some progressives think.,center
From a border wall with Mexico to a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. to a warmer embrace of Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, Vice President Joe Biden sees Donald Trump’s foreign policy as problematic at best and damaging at worst.,center
Biden will draw a contrast between the progress he says he and President Barack Obama have made over the last seven years and Trump’s proposals, which the vice president will paint as backwards-facing.,center
“But if we turn inward, undermine our most important relationships, or seek sound bite solutions in a world defined by complexity,” Biden will say.,center
In his prepared remarks, Biden says building a border wall would “disrespect our neighbors” and heighten anti-American feelings in the Western hemisphere.,center
On China, a nation with which Trump said the U.S. makes bad deals, Biden will say cooperation is essential and to resort to confrontation would make life harder for billions of people.,center
Biden has especially harsh words for Trump’s terrorism policy proposals and his plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.,center
It plays into the narrative of extremists,” Biden will say.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden joined the EU leaders’ meeting at the invitation of Council President Charles Michel and, at least from the screenshots that were made public, there were a whole lot of real smiles around the virtual conference table.,center
For Biden, however, they rolled out the virtual red carpet.,center
One EU diplomat said Michel sang Biden’s praises as he introduced him on the videoconference.,center
Biden, in turn, “was very colloquial, very empathetic, saying ‘we are in this together,'” the diplomat said.,center
President Joe Biden’s executive order signed on Friday establishes a Data Protection Review Court within the Department of Justice, which will allow EU citizens to file lawsuits on how their data is collected and used by U.S. intelligence agencies.,center
While the focus of the executive order is to ensure that companies can continue sending data between the EU and the U.S. while meeting the standards set by the Court of Justice of the European Union set in 2020, Biden’s privacy framework will also extend these privacy rights for American citizens, said Peter Harrell on Friday.,center
The NSC and other Biden administration officials are confident that the European Commission will approve the executive order and withstand any legal challenges from privacy advocates.,center
Max Schrems, a privacy advocate who filed suits that dismantled Privacy Shield in 2015 and 2020, told POLITICO that he was reviewing the details of Biden’s executive order and intends to prepare for a potential challenge.,center
Rudy Giuliani acknowledged on Thursday that he had asked top Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, an admission that comes as Capitol Hill Democrats investigate whether President Donald Trump and his personal lawyer are pressuring Ukraine’s government to dig up dirt on a 2020 election rival.,center
“So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?” CNN’s Chris Cuomo asked Giuliani in an interview on Thursday evening.,center
His comments come amid House Democrats’ intensifying look at allegations that Giuliani and Trump were squeezing Ukraine’s recently elected president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to reopen an investigation of a company connected to Biden’s son.,center
The chairmen of the House intelligence, foreign affairs and oversight committees wrote to White House counsel Pat Cipollone last week demanding all documents that reference the allegations against Biden’s son, as well as the transcript of a July 25 call between Trump and Zelenskiy.,center
Giuliani has for months encouraged Ukrainians to advance investigations into whether Biden’s diplomatic work with Ukraine intersected with his son’s role in a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch.,center
“In the course of investigating that, I found out this incredible story about Joe Biden, that he bribed the president of the Ukraine in order to fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son,” Giuliani said on CNN on Thursday.,center
Joe Biden isn’t going to run for president in 2016.,center
Add to these questions the voice of Beau Biden, his beloved son, beckoning his dad to run from the great beyond, as well as the pregnant silence of the man himself … and you had a nation on tenterhooks.,center
Biden, in his heart, wanted to run.,center
The key words in his announcement at the Rose Garden were: “Unfortunately, I believe we were out of time…” Ignore the platitudes about compromise, the guff about the middle class, the feel-good marmalade of “Honey, it’s gonna be OK.” It hurts Biden not to be able to run.,center
Biden isn’t running, but he isn’t hiding either.,center
Biden sees that as his record, too.,center
He will be the speaker of inconvenient truths, and Hillary had better be almost as well prepared for Biden (on the sidelines) as for her Republican opponent (whoever the heck it is).,center
Biden’s departure, when it comes, will see the disappearance of one of the last vestiges of the avuncular in American politics, which is now a sharp-elbowed place for acrid young people, their voices shrill, their demeanor edgy.,center
It may help her, in fact, to cultivate a homespun side on the campaign — i.e., to be a bit like Biden.,center
Biden’s parting paean to America, and to American optimism, stands in contrast to the Eeyore ways of the president he serves.,center
Too few American politicians are optimistic anymore, and for that alone we should be grateful to Joe Biden.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden warned Thursday night that American citizens currently in Ukraine should “leave now,” as “things could go crazy quickly.”,center
In an interview with American broadcaster NBC, Biden said about Russia: “It’s not like we’re dealing with a terrorist organization.,center
Biden added that there was not a scenario in which the U.S. government could be prompted to send troops to rescue Americans trying to flee the country in the event of a Russian strike: “That’s a world war where Americans and Russian start shooting at one another.,center
Biden said the U.S. would not swoop to evacuate Americans in the event of an attack.,center
How do you even find them?” Biden said.,center
Reacting to Biden’s comments, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Friday: “There is nothing new in this statement.,center
If Russian President Vladimir Putin is “foolish enough to go in, he’s smart enough not to, in fact, do anything that would negatively impact on American citizens,” Biden added.,center
Although Biden hasn’t entered the race, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll Monday found that many people would support him if he did.,center
Biden also did better than Clinton in hypothetical matchups with Republican candidates.,center
MANCHESTER, N.H. — Yes, Joe Biden said, the Democratic Party is in crisis.,center
Biden took the stage first with his wife, Jill Biden, thanking the crowd for their support over the years, especially after the death of his son Beau.,center
“Guys, I’m not running,” Biden insisted at the beginning of his speech, acknowledging with a smile on his face the speculation stoked by his appearance in the first-in-the-nation primary state — a declaration met by the crowd leaping to its feet for a brief,center
Biden didn’t mention the conversations he and his staff are having about building a strategy so that he’ll be best positioned to run if he decides to at the end of next year — or his longtime consultant Mike Donilon, who was perhaps most in favor of his running in 2016, who watched the speech from the side of the room.,center
“I don’t think Donald Trump can hear you!” New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley called out to the crowd, urging them to cheer more loudly for Biden as the event began.,center
Biden also stopped at several points to say nice things about Clinton, what a great president she’d have been, how she faced a double standard because she was a woman, even as he made clear over and over again how flat he clearly felt her campaign fell in breaking through.,center
It wasn’t the press’s fault, but they focused on all of that,” Biden said.,center
Biden mostly avoided talking directly about Trump, using his name only in passing asides, and referring to him at one section of his hour-long speech as “the new guy.” He said the Trump administration has been marked so far by “an assault on the things we value so deeply,” and pointing to a personal priority, said that the current administration hadn’t shown any interest in continuing his cancer moon-shot work, bringing together money and research to try to find a cure.,center
Democrats should be angry about Trump, Biden said, but they should be angry too about how much they’ve lost their way and what that’s meant for America.,center
What kind of country do we believe we want to be — and how do we get there?” Biden said.,center
The answer, Biden argued, was in talking more about three core American values: Dignity, thinking big, and optimism.,center
“Scapegoating has become a national political obligation,” Biden said.,center
Contrast that, Biden said, to the events he did for Clinton during the campaign with white union members in the Midwest, when he got them applauding for same sex marriage, stopping violence against women, and immigration.,center
“I was in what’s supposed to be those angry white guys, who are supposedly racists, who by the way a guy named Barack Obama won the last two times,” Biden said.,center
That’s wrong, Biden said, but so is what he called the “false debate” in the Democratic Party right now between appealing to working class voters and appealing to progressive values.,center
We’ve got to remember who we are,” Biden said.,center
Those 172,000 people we needed, a lot of them wondered whether it’d been forgotten they’d been abused by the system,” Biden said, referring to the combined margin in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.,center
New Hampshire Democrats seemed ready for whatever Biden is going to do next, leaving the room after a roadshow of Biden classic stories, from stories he always tells about certain conversations with world leaders to the night his father told him about having to leave him with family for a while to go find work, to the super-fast turns from stage whispering to booming in the microphone.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden tried to cool a diplomatic blow-up with French President Emmanuel Macron Wednesday, conceding Washington should have consulted Paris over an Indo-Pacific security pact that enraged France.,center
It said Biden would meet Macron in Europe next month, backed French and European engagement in the Indo-Pacific and supported greater European defense capabilities.,center
“The two leaders have decided to open a process of in-depth consultations, aimed at creating the conditions for ensuring confidence and proposing concrete measures toward common objectives,” the White House statement also said, adding that Biden and Macron’s meeting next month was intended “to reach shared understandings and maintain momentum in this process.”,center
Biden reaffirmed "the strategic importance of French and European engagement in the Indo-Pacific region," including recognizing EU's strategy for the region, published on the day of the announcement of the new three-way security agreement, known as AUKUS.,center
Biden also recognized "the importance of a stronger and more capable European defense" — a key priority for Macron.,center
Finally, Macron got explicit reassurance from Biden on continued U.S. support to France's counter-terrorism operations in the Sahel region of Africa.,center
LONDON — Britain was rebuffed by the Biden administration after multiple requests to develop an advanced trade and technology dialogue similar to structures the U.S. set up with the European Union.,center
On visits to Washington as a Cabinet minister over the past two years, Liz Truss urged U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and senior Biden administration officials to intensify talks with the U.K. to build clean technology supply chains and boost collaboration on artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductors.,center
Right now the U.K.’s conversations with the U.S. on these issues are “ad hoc” under the new Atlantic Charter Boris Johnson and Joe Biden signed around the G7 summit in 2021, they said, and “nothing institutional.”,center
Last October, Washington and London held the first meeting of the data and tech forum Johnson and Biden set up.,center
Hungary has hauled in the American ambassador for a dressing down after U.S. President Joe Biden’s remarks about Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán wanting to run a “dictatorship.”,center
During a presidential campaign stop in Pennsylvania on Friday,  Biden said that Orbán “doesn’t think democracy works and is looking for dictatorship,” after the Hungarian leader’s love-in with Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump in Florida last week.,center
The Biden administration has often been at odds with Orbán’s government, including over Hungary’s close ties to Russia.,center
Joe Biden's victory in the U.S. presidential election has been a win for transatlantic relations, but divisions over privacy may take longer to heal.,center
In the lead-up to the U.S. election, public officials, company executives, privacy advocates and outside legal experts told POLITICO that a Biden win may in fact hit the brakes on a EU-U.S. data deal, with changes to key personnel in Washington expected to slow negotiations while there would be little difference in the two administrations' stances on privacy and national security.,center
“It could take Biden around six months to have a new cabinet in place to sign off on the U.S.’s negotiating position,” the official said.,center
Additionally, national security law — which provides American agencies far-reaching means to collect data on non-U.S. citizens — is a rare area where few major differences exist between incoming Biden and outgoing Trump administrations.,center
“What would it look like if Biden moved heaven and earth to get something through and it fails when the ECJ says it’s not enough,” Hengesbaugh said.,center
HELSINKI, Finland — President Joe Biden wrapped up his visit to Europe on Thursday touting the strength of NATO and the alliance’s ability to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin.,center
Biden capped off his trip in Helsinki, projecting a dramatically different presence than the last American president to visit the Finnish capital.,center
This time, Biden touted the strength of the alliance designed to halt Putin, with NATO only growing in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,center
“Putin’s already lost the war,” Biden declared at a brief trip-ending news conference.,center
Biden left Europe in a jubilant mood, fresh off essentially welcoming Sweden into the alliance and displaying transatlantic unity that is deeply personal to the president.,center
A day earlier, in the week’s centerpiece speech from the NATO summit in Lithuania, Biden defended his policies and rallied democracies to keep up the fight against tyranny in Ukraine and around the world.,center
And the problem for Biden is that much of what comes next isn’t wholly in his control.,center
What’s more, those long-term commitments to Ukraine — which Biden likens to America’s support for Israel — will require congressional lawmakers to commit to staying the course for years.,center
On the sluggish start to the Ukrainian counteroffensive, Biden told reporters that even Zelenskyy acknowledged to him that it was “a hard slog.”,center
And then there’s next year’s U.S. election, where Trump, the Republican frontrunner, could likely dismantle what Biden helped build within months of returning to the Oval Office.,center
The echoes of Trump and Putin’s July 2018 summit reverberated throughout Biden’s meeting with Finnish President Sauli Niinistö.,center
Both Biden and Niinistö tried to downplay the possibility that a return of Trump would threaten the alliance.,center
Biden said he would “absolutely guarantee” that the U.S. would remain in NATO, touting support from both parties and downplaying the power of “the extreme elements of one party.”,center
In its public and private messaging, the Biden administration repeated that Ukraine still wasn’t ready for NATO membership, even if the war with Russia somehow ended soon.,center
Both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris urged Israel to wrap up its military operations in Gaza, arguing that a key obstacle to a cease-fire and hostage release deal has now been eliminated.,center
Every administration has to readjust to respond to world events, but the Israel-Hamas conflict has been particularly disruptive to Biden’s other foreign policy efforts.,center
Les républicains estiment que le fait que le président sortant Joe Biden ait largement disparu de la scène internationale et des médias — à l’exception de sa décision de gracier son fils Hunter le mois dernier — a joué en sa faveur.,center
Lorsque Trump était à Paris, la première dame, Jill Biden, était présente à la place de son mari.,center
“Je pense qu’il y a un vide avec Biden, en particulier avec les leaders internationaux.,center
Pour l’investiture de Joe Biden, Google a donné 337 500 dollars, Microsoft 500 000 et Amazon près de 277 000, auxquels s’ajoutent 50 000 pour des logiciels et des services d’hébergement web, selon la Commission électorale fédérale.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden landed Wednesday in Israel and told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the attack Tuesday night on the al-Ahli hospital in Gaza, in which hundreds are feared dead, it appears to have been carried out by the “other team, not you.”,center
“Based on what I have seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you,” Biden said.,center
Biden said that he’s “deeply saddened and outraged by the incident,” adding “the U.S. will continue to support Israel.” He did not provide evidence for his remarks that the deadly explosion might have been caused by Palestinian militants.,center
“I’m looking forward to having a discussion about what happens from here,” Biden told Netanyahu.,center
Asked later by reporters what made him believe Israel was not behind the hospital explosion, Biden replied: “The data I was shown by my defense department.”,center
Joe Biden managed to tread carefully around historic and current political sensitivities during the first part of his trip to the island of Ireland this week, marking 25 years since the U.S.-brokered Good Friday Agreement sought to secure lasting peace for Northern Ireland.,center
At the end of a rambling speech in a pub Wednesday night, Biden — flanked by Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin and star rugby player Rob Kearney, a distant cousin — tried to pay a compliment to one of Kearney’s greatest sporting accomplishments.,center
Trouble is, Biden let slip a reference that could well reflect his affinity with Irish rebel history and its folk songs.,center
“He’s a hell of a rugby player, and he beat the hell out of the Black and Tans,” Biden said to audience laughter.,center
The unrelentingly pro-Biden coverage on state broadcaster RTÉ, which televised his speech live, didn’t acknowledge the mistake.,center
“Well, that’s Joe Biden: a little bit sentimental, a little bit schmaltzy, but a thoroughly decent guy and a great friend to Ireland.,center
“The greatest gift Ireland wanted from Joe Biden was a signature gaffe.,center
Attempting to hose down the row on Thursday, Biden aide Amanda Sloat, the National Security Council senior director for Europe, said: “I think for everyone in Ireland who was a rugby fan it was incredibly clear that the president was talking about the All Blacks and Ireland’s defeat of the New Zealand team in 2016.”,center
Lost in the shuffle was Biden’s other Kearney gaffe: He still hasn’t figured out how to say his name.,center
When introducing Kearney at the White House on St. Patrick’s Day, Biden called him Keer-ney.,center
Biden stuck with Keer-ney on Wednesday.,center
Joe Biden will approach Europe like every other American president (save his immediate predecessor) since World War II.,center
If that too rings a bell, it might be because Joe Biden, a young senator on the foreign relations committee in 1981, made exactly the same move in the opening months of his own presidency.,center
John McCain, the deceased American war hero and longtime Biden friend, liked to say that “history doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes.” The maxim (often attributed to Mark Twain) would serve as a good motto for Biden’s trip to Europe this week, where he’ll participate in an alphabet soup of summits, from the G7 to NATO.,center
Biden’s moves to rejoin the Paris climate accord, his pledge to steel NATO against Russian aggression and his effort to reactivate the Iran nuclear deal have left Europeans positively giddy.,center
After just a few months in office, Tony Blinken, Biden’s French-speaking secretary of state (who happened to write a book about Reagan’s pipeline spat in the 1980s), is welcomed like an old family friend.,center
(Nuland recently joined the Biden administration as the No. 3 in the State Department.),center
Compared to that fraught history, the Biden years are likely to look like a honeymoon.,center
Given the EU’s inability to speak with one voice on foreign policy and its reluctance to invest significantly more into defense, some argue that Europe doesn’t matter much to Washington anymore in geostrategic terms, especially when it comes to the centerpiece of Biden’s foreign policy — China.,center
Yet the lengths Biden has gone to woo Europe suggest otherwise.,center
Europe may not be on the front line of Washington’s effort to counter Chinese influence, but Biden doesn’t want it to be.,center
Europe experienced a dramatic increase in China’s engagement with the region during the Trump years, culminating in the landmark investment agreement Beijing signed with the EU in late December, just weeks before Biden took office.,center
The deal served as a wake-up call for the incoming Biden administration that it couldn’t assume Europe would be in its corner on China.,center
Beijing’s own actions since, including the continued crackdown against its Muslim minority and the sanctioning of European politicians critical of its course, have left the accord in limbo, giving the Biden administration a welcome break.,center
“The China debate in Europe is shifting, not so much because of Biden, but because of [Chinese President] Xi Jinping,” said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, the head of the German Marshall Fund’s Berlin office.,center
BERLIN — Until Sunday, Europe thought Joe Biden was an expert on foreign policy.,center
Even those who cheered Biden’s election and believed he could ease the recent tensions in the transatlantic relationship said they regarded the withdrawal from Afghanistan as nothing short of a mistake of historic magnitude.,center
He has known Biden for decades and was optimistic about his prospects.,center
While Merkel has avoided direct criticism of Biden, behind the scenes she has made it clear that she considered the hasty withdrawal a mistake.,center
Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk, the maker of blockbuster weight-loss drugs, has hit back at Joe Biden after the U.S. president accused them of “ripping off” consumers, saying the real problem is America's health-care system.,center
Biden and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders co-authored an op-ed in USA Today on Tuesday accusing Novo Nordisk of “price gouging” and “corporate greed” for charging Americans  many times more than Europeans for diabetes and obesity drugs Ozempic and Wegovy.,center
“Why should people in Burlington, Vermont, pay so much more than people in Copenhagen or Berlin for the same drug?” Biden and Sanders asked.,center
“If the prices of these drugs are not substantially reduced, they have the potential to bankrupt the American healthcare system,” Biden and Sanders wrote.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw from the White House race may well turn 2024 into the Year of the Woman — namely, that of Vice President Kamala Harris who, armed with the outgoing president’s endorsement, can now be considered the front-runner to replace him atop the Democratic ticket.,center
But that was a choice made when Biden was still heading the Democratic ticket.,center
So, with a wounded Biden in the race, the VP pick made electoral sense: Vance’s personal journey from Rust Belt poverty — and the Appalachian origins of his dysfunctional hillbilly family — to academic and political stardom is compelling.,center
Last week, while pressure was mounting on Biden to quit the race, Trump was still trailing the ailing incumbent among women voters in Florida — and that says a lot in and of itself.,center
It voted Trump in 2016 and 2020, and in a poll conducted by FOX 13/Insider Advantage, the former president was holding an overall 6-point lead over Biden.,center
But that wasn’t the case among women voters — Biden still had a narrow lead.,center
KYIV — As U.S. presidential hopefuls Joe Biden and Donald Trump hashed it out on screen, a lot was on the line for us.,center
Though he may be tired and old, Biden is still more a predictable figure for Ukrainians, as he supports providing aid to Kyiv that helps us stand against the Kremlin.,center
Trump used the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion to make Biden appear weak, saying that Putin would have never invaded if Trump himself was president.,center
Biden, for his part, called Putin a war criminal, who will not stop if he gets Ukraine and would attack other countries of Europe, as he is aiming to “restore his Soviet empire.”,center
“Biden is giving $200 billion or more to Ukraine.,center
“Biden speaks the truth, but we haven’t heard from him about any real steps toward peace either, unfortunately.”,center
As a politician, by default Trump will criticize everything Biden did, including his policy on Ukraine, Merezhko said.,center
As U.S. President Joe Biden’s outgoing administration green-lights Kyiv’s use of long-range ATACMS against Russia, Washington appears to be offering Ukraine the lifeline it has desperately sought, mere months before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could radically roll back aid and pressure a struggling Ukraine to accept a disadvantageous peace deal.,center
Early signs suggest that Moscow won’t be turning the other cheek to Biden’s about-face.,center
DUBLIN — The collective sigh of relief exuded across Western Europe as the U.S. election was called for Democratic nominee Joe Biden was more audible in some capitals than others.,center
Biden, the most Irish of U.S. presidents since John F.,center
Biden spoke with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin on Tuesday.,center
In a statement, the Irish government said the two men had a “warm conversation” and Biden “recalled his strong Irish roots and his visit to Ireland with his family in 2016” as well as reaffirming “his full support for the Good Friday Agreement.”,center
But beyond the emotional resonance, Biden’s victory is something of a diplomatic coup for Dublin.,center
“Joe Biden is as near as it gets to a Lotto win for Ireland — and a Euro Lotto win at that,” Tommie Gorman, RTÉ’s former Europe editor and current Northern Ireland editor, told the public broadcaster.,center
With Biden in the White House, Ireland may soon be able to contribute something in return, using its special access to Biden to help the EU rebuild the transatlantic alliance.,center
The first test of relations between the two powers will come when Europe and the Biden administration negotiate on trade and attempt to end the long-running Boeing-Airbus trade dispute.,center
Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney reacted to Biden’s victory over the weekend by expressing hope the Democratic president-elect would appoint members of his Irish-American entourage to key positions in government.,center
U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss will hold a bilateral meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday at the U.N. General Assembly, her office said Saturday.,center
Biden is among the many leaders heading to London ahead of Queen Elizabeth II’s state funeral on Monday.,center
Biden is set to address the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday, after his speech was pushed back a day due to the queen’s funeral.,center
The White House on Friday categorically disputed a media report that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had turned down a last-minute invite from U.S. President Joe Biden to meet in Washington, adding that both leaders are planning to meet there next month.,center
Watson was responding to a report from German outlet Spiegel, which said Scholz had declined a late-notice invitation from Biden to come to the White House and discuss current tensions at the Ukrainian-Russian border, where Russia has amassed around 100,000 troops and threatened military action if the West does not meet certain security demands.,center
“We have a chance to rip the roots of systemic racism out of this country,” Biden says in the Independence Day video shared with POLITICO.,center
Joe Biden is centering racial justice in his Fourth of July message, deepening the contrast with President Donald Trump.,center
“We have a chance to rip the roots of systemic racism out of this country,” Biden says in the Independence Day video shared with POLITICO, which features images of protests though the years and includes references to Bull Connor, Martin Luther King, George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement.,center
While Biden does not mention Trump, his focus on marginalized and oppressed communities extends the strikingly different tones on race from both men since the death of Floyd in police custody sparked global outrage and galvanized a moment.,center
It also marks another holiday where their disparate approaches were laid bare: In May, when they honored Memorial Day, Biden wore a mask and Trump didn’t.,center
On Saturday, Trump hosts a salute to America event in Washington while Biden will appear later Saturday at the Essence Festival of Culture to answer questions from black women.,center
Joe Biden announced Sunday he would not be seeking reelection as United States president in the country’s November election, and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to run in his stead.,center
Their responses fell into three broad categories: those praising Biden for his decision, those using the moment to express confidence in Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, and those who appeared to simply enjoy being online during such an important moment.,center
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on X: “My friend @POTUS Joe Biden has achieved a lot: for his country, for Europe, for the world.,center
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk also praised Biden on X: “You’ve taken many difficult decisions thanks to which Poland, America and the world are safer, and democracy stronger.,center
United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he respected Biden’s choice, adding on X: “I know that, as he has done throughout his remarkable career, he will have made his decision based on what he believes is best for the American people.”,center
Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni went one step further in an Instagram post, thanking Biden for his service and revealing a figurine of Kamala Harris, which he says lives on his desk in Brussels.,center
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude for Biden’s “unwavering support for Ukraine’s fight for freedom,” describing his decision to step down as “tough but strong.”,center
“We will always be thankful for President Biden’s leadership.,center
For Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, who often plays the role of the Kremlin’s attack dog, Biden’s stepping down isn’t enough.,center
She wrote on Telegram: “The next step after Biden’s written statement about him dropping out of the electoral race should be an investigation into collusion between the American media and certain political circles to cover up the truth about his mental condition [to] manipulate public opinion to the benefit of one political party.”,center
Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump promised to dismember President Joe Biden’s climate legislation, pump out more planet-warming fossil fuels and yank the United States from the Paris climate agreement once again.,center
European Commission president’s close relationship with Joe Biden could be a liability.,center
SAN DIEGO — Rishi Sunak joined Joe Biden and Australian premier Anthony Albanese at a submarine base in California to hail a new defense megadeal between the three nations.,center
Biden told the audience of around 150 invited dignitaries the deal would bring significant numbers of jobs to all three countries: “The United States could not think of two better friends to stand with,” he told Sunak and Albanese.,center
DUBLIN — Joe Biden said he traveled to Northern Ireland last month “to make sure the Brits didn’t screw around” with the region’s peace process — a blunt take that drew gasps from U.K. and unionist politicians.,center
Biden started his four-day visit throughout the island of Ireland in the Northern Irish capital, where tensions over post-Brexit trade rules have torn apart the region’s unity government.,center
According to the transcript, Biden told party supporters at a private New York residence that he had visited Belfast “to make sure they weren’t — the Brits didn’t screw around and Northern Ireland didn’t walk away from their commitments.”,center
“It’s unbelievable and frightening to think this man is the leader of the free world,” said Sammy Wilson, who criticized Biden’s remarks as both hostile to unionists and politically incoherent.,center
Even the leader of Northern Ireland’s middle-ground Alliance Party, Naomi Long, was taken aback when told of Biden’s remarks.,center
“Oh dear,” she said, before drawing a distinction between such “Brit-bashing” rhetoric versus Biden’s practical help, particularly his appointment of an economic envoy, Joe Kennedy III, to promote increased U.S. investment in Northern Ireland.,center
“Joe [Biden] has always been slightly gaffe-prone, I don’t think that’s news to anybody.,center
Shailesh Vara, a Brexiteer MP who served briefly as Northern Ireland secretary in the dying days of Boris Johnson’s administration, called it “deeply regrettable that President Biden has to use such language to further his reelection chances in the U.S.”,center
But Simon Hoare, chairman of the Northern Ireland affairs committee and a prominent Conservative critic of Brexit, said Biden’s remarks reflected the reality that the U.K. government, under Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, had demonstrated a willingness to break its internationally binding Withdrawal Treaty with the EU.,center
His successor, Joe Biden, is proving much trickier — a friend who says all the right things but leaves you in the lurch when it counts.,center
From Washington’s surprise withdrawal from Afghanistan to the transatlantic blowup over submarine sales to Australia (AUKUS) and, now, a growing spat over the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offers tax incentives and subsidies to green U.S. businesses, the Biden administration has, time and again, caught Europe off guard.,center
A current example is the blooming transatlantic argument over Biden’s IRA.,center
Amid an energy crisis that has large parts of the European Union economy staring into an abyss, French President Emmanuel Macron has led the charge against Biden’s IRA, accusing Washington of maintaining a “double standard” on energy and trade.,center
According to an EU diplomat who spoke to POLITICO ahead of a trade ministers’ meeting on Friday, members of the bloc still hope that Biden will send the IRA back to Congress for resizing, a prospect U.S. officials say is about as likely as canceling Thanksgiving.,center
Again, Biden’s America is looking after its interests while the EU’s left to groan about missed signals, hurt feelings and unfair practices.,center
Biden’s election, followed by the war in Ukraine and Washington’s massive investment in shoring up NATO’s eastern flank, was meant to signal the U.S.’s decisive return to the European sphere.,center
In the long run, Biden’s polite indifference may prove more deadly.,center
PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to Washington this week looks like the last big-ticket diplomatic gala event where Europe can persuade U.S. President Joe Biden to go easy on his EU allies and avoid a trade war.,center
Macron will get the cordon bleu, black-tie treatment — basking in all the pomp and ceremony of the first full state visit that Biden has laid on, with a troop review and musical accompaniment from Grammy-award winning musician Jon Batiste.,center
Beneath the razzmatazz, however, Macron has a very clear wish list for Biden.,center
If Biden can't deliver, a transatlantic trade war will be more or less inevitable, risking a Europe vs.,center
“[Biden] must take into account what happens after the war.,center
Biden and his counterpart are expected to talk effusively of all the things that unite France and the U.S.: a shared history (not least in the American war of independence), their support for Ukraine and their renewed commitment to NATO.,center
After a ceremony at Arlington military cemetery and a private dinner with the Bidens on Wednesday, the French president will be officially welcomed at the White House with cannon volleys and a review of the troops on Thursday.,center
“Biden is an internationalist, he likes Europeans.,center
[Macron and Biden] can get along.,center
In addition to adjusting the IRA legislation so that European manufacturers benefit from the same perks granted to Canadian and Mexican ones, the French also want the Biden administration to pressure companies selling liquefied natural gas to Europe to keep prices acceptable and help Europeans bear the brunt of the sanctions.,center
The day the Bidens took over Paradigm Global Advisors was a memorable one.,center
In the late summer of 2006 Joe Biden’s son Hunter and Joe’s younger brother, James, purchased the firm.,center
After the firing, the two large men escorted the fund’s president out of the firm’s midtown Manhattan office, and James Biden laid out his vision for the fund’s future.,center
“We’ve got people all around the world who want to invest in Joe Biden.”,center
According to the executive, James Biden made it clear he viewed the fund as a way to take money from rich foreigners who could not legally give money to his older brother or his campaign account.,center
“We’ve got investors lined up in a line of 747s filled with cash ready to invest in this company,” the executive remembers James Biden saying.,center
Biden refers to himself as “Middle-Class Joe,” and presents himself as a corrective to a system rigged by financiers and networked corporate elites.,center
At this, the executive recalled, Beau Biden, who was then running for attorney general of Delaware, turned bright red.,center
A spokesman for James and Hunter Biden said no such episode ever occurred.,center
Beau Biden died in 2015, at 46.,center
Three former Paradigm executives said James and Hunter Biden also sought to capitalize on Joe’s strong ties to labor unions in the hopes of landing investments from them; Charles Provini, who briefly served as Paradigm’s president, said both James and Hunter repeatedly cited Joe’s political ties when they recruited him to work for the fund.,center
Documents submitted as part of a legal dispute over Paradigm’s acquisition show James Biden planned to solicit investments for it from union pension funds.,center
As Joe Biden runs for the Democratic presidential nomination on the argument he can strongly appeal to the party’s dwindling base of blue-collar supporters, the candidate has often made the point that he hasn’t gotten rich from his decades in politics.,center
Biden’s image as a straight-shooting man of the people, however, is clouded by the careers of his son and brother, who have lengthy track records of making, or seeking, deals that cash in on his name.,center
Interviews, court records, government filings and news reports reveal that some members of the Biden family have consistently mixed business and politics over nearly half a century, moving from one business to the next as Joe’s stature in Washington grew.,center
None of the ventures appear to have been runaway successes, and Biden’s relatives have not been accused of criminal wrongdoing in their dealings.,center
A spokesman for Biden’s campaign, Andrew Bates, declined to comment for this story.,center
Their ventures, over nearly half a century, have regularly raised conflict-of-interest questions and brought the Biden family into potentially compromising associations.,center
This investigation offers the most comprehensive account to date of the politically tinged business activities of Biden’s brother and son, and is the first time former associates of James and Hunter have alleged that the pair explicitly sought to make money off of Joe’s political connections.,center
Within weeks of the encounter at Paradigm Global Advisors, Beau Biden won his race for Delaware attorney general, and never established any recorded ties to Paradigm.,center
There is no indication the Bidens ever succeeded in bringing new foreign money into the fund, but their involvement with Paradigm, which spanned the final two years of Joe’s Senate career and first two years of his vice presidency, was troubled for other reasons: In James and Hunter’s five-year tenure, Paradigm became associated with a number of alleged and confirmed frauds, including Allen Stanford’s multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme, while seeking to draw on their powerful relative’s political allies for financing.,center
James Biden, known socially as Jimmy, is seven years younger than Joe and a dead ringer for his famous older brother.,center
Joe Biden was in touch with two of those banks about his brother’s loans, once to scold a bank executive about invoking his name in attempts to collect on overdue payments.,center
There’s no evidence that Joe Biden used his power inappropriately or took action to benefit his relatives with respect to these ventures.,center
“Joe Biden needs to recognize it’s a problem,” said Richard Painter, a former chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W.,center
Painter said Biden should pledge that if he were elected president, he would ask his relatives to refrain from business practices that could pose ethical quandaries, such as taking foreign sources of financing.,center
The Biden involvement began in January 2006.,center
James Biden called Anthony Lotito, a New York financial adviser, and said his older brother, Joe, wanted his son Hunter to find a job outside of lobbying to avoid damaging his planned campaign for the presidency, according to a complaint Lotito later filed in a New York court, after his relationship with James and Hunter soured.,center

According to court filings, James Biden and Lotito had been introduced years earlier by Tom Scotto, a former president of New York’s Detectives’ Endowment Association, a union, around 2002.,center
Scotto, who denied wrongdoing at the time, declined to comment on his relationship with James Biden and Lotito.,center
Lotito and Biden later co-founded a company called Americore International Security, a private security firm, according to court filings.,center
Not much is known about Americore, though James Biden said in court filings that the business was not successful.,center
James and Hunter brought in Larry Rasky, a lobbyist and longtime Biden adviser, who at one point, according to court records, was going to provide $1 million in financing.,center
Partners in the firm had befriended the Biden sons, steering business to Beau’s Delaware law firm and donations to Biden’s campaign coffers.,center
SimmonsCooper’s interests aligned with Joe Biden’s views.,center
In February 2009, less than a month after Joe Biden was sworn in as vice president, Allen Stanford was charged with a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme, one of the largest in U.S. history.,center
At one point after the Bidens purchased the fund, one of the executives recalled, groups of firefighters started trekking up in small groups to Paradigm’s offices and leaving him checks for a few thousand dollars each, about 10 in total over the course of a few days.,center
Firefighters unions have been among Joe Biden’s closest political allies since the start of his political career.,center
In the Bidens’ first months at the helm, Paradigm reached an arrangement with Longship Capital Management, a New York investment firm, in which Longship would serve as an investment adviser to Paradigm, according to an Securities and Exchange Commission filing.,center
There is no evidence Joe Biden was involved in the meeting.,center
By this point, “The Bidens didn’t have access to the day-to-day operation of Paradigm at all,” this executive said.,center
“The only thing the Bidens could do was get paid or request to get money out of the hedge fund.” The executive said the Bidens had the right to withdraw the funds and that the transaction was cleared through counsel.,center

While James and Hunter Biden were trying to succeed in the world of high finance, Joe Biden was seeking the Democratic nomination for the presidency, eventually becoming Barack Obama’s running mate after his own bid foundered.,center
In February 2009, less than a month after Joe Biden was sworn in as vice president and Hunter served as honorary co-chairman of the inaugural committee, Stanford was charged with a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme, one of the largest in U.S. history.,center
Paradigm was not the first Biden family business venture to fail after attracting unwanted attention.,center
“The Bidens refused to pay the bill, repeatedly citing their political connections and family status as a basis for disclaiming the obligation,” Lotito claimed in his complaint.,center
“The Bidens threatened to use their alleged connections with a former United States Senator to retaliate against counsel for insisting that his bill be paid, claiming that the former senator was prepared to use his influence with a federal judge to disadvantage counsel in a proceeding then pending before that court.” James and Hunter denied those allegations.,center
A month after Joe Biden was elected vice president, the Justice Department seized the building that housed Paradigm’s offices, 650 Fifth Ave., New York, N.Y., alleging that it was secretly owned by the same Iranian bank that was financing the nation’s nuclear program.,center

Another former executive said negative press about Paradigm’s ties to fraudulent funds made James and Hunter wary of more scrutiny of “potential conflicts of interest or tie-ins to the Biden family.” As a result, the executive said, “They really just chose to liquidate the hedge fund and give back the money to the investors.” The former WashingtonFirst executive said James and Hunter shut down Paradigm because the global recession had cut into its revenues.,center
Paradigm was not the first Biden family business venture to fail after attracting unwanted attention.,center
The Bidens earned a reputation for being tight-knit and fiercely loyal to one another.,center
No sooner was freshman lawmaker Joe Biden seated on the Senate Banking Committee than James became the beneficiary of business loans that were described in news accounts at the time as unusually generous because of the relatively large amount of money he was able to borrow with little or no collateral and a lack of relevant prior experience.,center
In early 1973, on the heels of Joe’s election to the Senate, James Biden and a business partner decided to open a nightclub.,center
The paper looked into it: “The answer, according to three former officers of the troubled Farmers Bank, is the Biden name,” reported Delaware’s News Journal.,center
That year, Joe Biden called Farmers’ chairman, A.,center
The Bidens told the News Journal that the senator placed the call only because the bank was telling James that a default would be embarrassing for Joe.,center
Another figure tied to Farmers Bank, the politically connected financier Norman Rales, extended James Biden an unsecured loan.,center
The Bidens have said that Hunter avoided lobbying his father.,center
Rales, who did extensive business with Farmers, extended the loan to James through Joe Biden’s former law firm, Walsh, Monzack & Owens.,center
Owens, was a Biden brother-in-law, having married Joe’s sister and political confidante, Valerie.,center
The DOJ also scrutinized unusual loans made by Farmers, including the Biden loan.,center
In 1978, assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Hoffman — who would go on to serve as a top aide to Biden in the Senate and the White House — told the Philadelphia Daily News that the government found nothing improper about Farmers’ loan to James.,center
In 1975, the same year Farmers was having difficulty collecting on its original night club loan, James Biden and his partners went to a Philadelphia bank, First Pennsylvania, to get more money to expand their operation.,center
Delaware’s News Journal would later report that the office of Pennsylvania’s then-governor, Democrat Milton Shapp, had recommended James Biden for the First Pennsylvania loan.,center
It also emerged that after the loan was made, First Pennsylvania met with Joe Biden to discuss it.,center
It was my brother’s business,” Joe Biden told the Philadelphia Daily News in 1978, though the bank representative he named, William Githens, was in fact a senior vice president.,center
By early 1977, unable to make payments on his loans, James Biden had to give up the struggling club.,center
A year later, the man who took it over from him, Salvatore Cardile, was fighting First Pennsylvania in court, claiming the bank had set him up to take the failing club off of James Biden’s hands.,center
There is no indication that Joe Biden helped his brother obtain any of the loans.,center
In both instances, the Bidens told the press that Joe did nothing to help James get the loans.,center

But Biden and many of his fellow liberals in Congress had reservations about passing any measure that absolved tobacco companies of further liability.,center
He would also remain in touch with the Bidens.,center
During the tobacco fight, James Biden’s services had been recommended to Scruggs by former Mississippi State Auditor Steve Patterson.,center
Before serving as auditor, Patterson, a Democrat, had served as a regional director for Joe Biden’s 1988 presidential primary bid.,center
The plan was to open a Washington law and lobbying practice with the name Patterson, Balducci and Biden.,center
James was not an attorney, but his wife, Sara Biden, a Duke-educated lawyer, would be a partner, and Hunter Biden was expected to be involved, according to Wilkie’s book.,center
Sara Biden referred a request for comment to Joe Biden’s campaign.,center
Those plans were heating up around August 2007, when Patterson, Balducci and Scruggs co-hosted a high-dollar fundraiser for Joe Biden’s presidential campaign in Oxford, Mississippi.,center
In an email, Stith described James Biden as a longtime acquaintance but said they had never gone into business together nor, so far as he could remember, even talked about it.,center
In September, the FBI picked up a wiretapped phone call between the Mississippians in which Balducci told Patterson, “We really need to push on the Senate bill.” He also said, “We’re going to meet with the Bidens around noon,” and mentioned a meeting with “black farmers.” It is unclear whether the meeting occurred.,center
At the time, Biden was backing legislation to compensate black farmers who had faced discrimination when seeking loans and subsidies from the Department of Agriculture.,center
After the scandal erupted in public in the midst of the presidential campaign, Biden returned donations from the two men and Scruggs.,center
Before he published the book, Wilkie — who covered Joe Biden’s career on the New Castle County Council as a local Delaware reporter in the 1970s — said he reached out to the vice president’s office to offer him a briefing on its contents.,center
There is no allegation that James Biden was a party to his would-be colleagues’ misdeeds or was even aware of them before their arrests, but Wilkie said he is nevertheless shocked that James’ association with the crew has not received greater attention.,center
“I thought surely someone in Washington would pick up on this thing because of the Biden name,” he said.,center
During this time, Hunter Biden was busy making a living in his father’s wake.,center
For years, beginning in the late ’90s, Joe Biden had been a top Democratic supporter of a controversial bankruptcy bill that aided issuers of credit card debt, like MBNA, by making it harder for borrowers to seek bankruptcy protections.,center
At his new firm, Oldaker, Biden & Belair, Hunter also lobbied for the music-sharing service Napster while the Judiciary Committee, on which Joe sat, took on digital music piracy and represented public universities seeking congressional earmarks.,center
The Bidens have said that Hunter avoided lobbying his father.,center
After Paradigm, James Biden landed a new gig.,center
Joe Biden was leading the administration’s Iraq policy.,center
A former executive at HillStone and a person involved in negotiating TRAC’s deal with the Iraqi government both told POLITICO that James Biden played no role in the deal, but the founder of HillStone’s parent company has said the Biden name was an asset.,center
In 2014, as Joe Biden led the administration’s response to the annexation of the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine, Hunter and Archer received appointments to the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings.,center
Biden and his wife, Jill, have set about providing for themselves, earning more than $15 million in the two years following the end of his vice presidency in early 2017.,center
Ho’s first call, according to The New York Times, was to James Biden, who told the paper Ho had been trying to reach Hunter.,center
In 2017, Joe Biden told a Vanity Fair writer that he sometimes wished that one of his children had gotten rich in order to provide for him in his old age.,center
Biden and his wife, Jill, have set about providing for themselves, earning more than $15 million in the two years following the end of his vice presidency in early 2017.,center
In 2012, Fox Business pegged James Biden’s net worth at $7 million.,center
In 2013, James and Sara Biden bought a vacation house on Keewaydin Island in Florida for $2.5 million.,center
The alleged arrangements would be some of the closest known links between a Biden relative and a foreign government.,center
Jim Biden played a major role in a company called Americore, which the government has accused of massive Medicare fraud.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden is set to meet with fellow NATO leaders on Thursday in Brussels to discuss Russia's invasion of its neighbor.,center
Joe Biden’s European friends may be miffed about his climate law.,center
Within the center-right European People's Party, the largest alliance of parties in the European Parliament, officials are smarting over why their own politicians aren't taking a page from the Biden playbook.,center
Biden's law has now brought their grumbling to the surface.,center
On Thursday, a wing of EPP lawmakers defected during a Parliament vote over whether to back von der Leyen's planned response to Biden’s marquee green spending bill, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).,center
Essentially, they want it to feel more like Biden's plan.,center
And then comes Biden with his IRA.,center
European leaders were blindsided last summer when Biden signed the IRA into law.,center
But for the EPP, ostensibly on the opposite side to Biden’s Democrats, the law is also serving as bitter inspiration.,center
Biden’s IRA approaches the same goal by different means.,center
Viewed from bureaucratic, free-trading Brussels, Biden’s climate policy looks more sleek, geopolitically muscular — and, notably for the EPP, more appealing to voters on the right than anything actually coming out of the EPP-led Commission.,center
The irony is that Biden and the Democrats probably wouldn't have chosen this path were it not for Republicans' decades-long refusal to move any form of climate regulation through Congress.,center
If Biden and his party had their druthers, Biden's climate policy might have looked far more like the Brussels model.,center
In other words, the EPP is looking to emulate Biden’s law — at least in spirit, if not in legalese.,center
An adviser to presidential candidate Joe Biden and senior Democrats warned late Tuesday that Britain must preserve international law around the border of Northern Ireland to protect the Good Friday Agreement.,center
“As the U.K. and EU work out their relationship, any arrangements must protect the Good Friday Agreement and prevent the return of a hard border,” tweeted Antony Blinken, a senior foreign policy adviser for the Biden campaign, noting “Joe Biden is committed to preserving the hard-earned peace & stability in Northern Ireland.”,center
LONDON — He’s embraced Bidenomics.,center
Now, U.K. Labour leader Keir Starmer wants to meet U.S. President Joe Biden for face-to-face talks before both men head into elections next year.,center
The U.K. opposition leader — on course to become Britain’s next prime minister, if current polling proves correct — is seeking talks with Biden in 2024, two Labour Party officials told POLITICO.,center
Lammy has emerged as a key figure in Labour’s efforts to deepen its relationship with the Biden administration.,center
But while polls suggest Starmer is on course for victory in 2024, Biden faces a struggle to be re-elected.,center
There are also questions over whether Starmer’s team is really prepared for a possible win by former U.S. President Donald Trump in 2024 — and therefore how warmly the party should embrace Biden’s economic ideas in the meantime.,center
Biden, however, has remained elusive — even though Labour politicians and officials have become a regular presence in Washington over the past year.,center
In interviews and in private, Labour politicians stress their closeness in policy terms to the Biden administration as well as their embrace of Bidenomics — an interventionist U.S. policy characterized by robust green subsidies and a push for domestic manufacturing.,center
They added: “The other thing which has been a real shared point is the green transition … Joe Biden has said ‘when I think climate, I think jobs, jobs jobs.’ And I think that’s very similar in terms of the approach that that we will want to take as well.”,center
Labour’s closeness to Biden’s administration has been likened by some to Tony Blair’s courtship of Bill Clinton’s Democrats in the run-up to the 1997 general election and the 1996 presidential run in the U.S.,center
Yet that proximity presents Starmer and Reeves with a problem: “If the electorate rejects [Bidenomics] in America, that puts them in a difficult position,” former Starmer aide Chris Ward told POLITICO’s Westminster Insider podcast.,center
Labour’s embrace of Biden also raises questions about the party’s preparedness for a Trump victory in November 2024.,center
“Now the party has to develop a foreign policy that is not just sticking as close to President Biden as possible.”,center
Lammy and Shadow Defense Secretary John Healey traveled to Washington in September to meet senior American politicians, and held lengthy talks with Biden’s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.,center
Joe Biden may have initially set Europe on its heels with his surprise proposal to suspend intellectual property rights, but at a European Council summit in Porto, Portugal, top EU officials pushed back hard, saying Washington has not put forward a specific plan and that, in the near term, waiving patents would not help with the immediate, urgent need to increase production in poorer countries.,center
The criticism of Biden marked an escalation in the contest for supremacy in vaccine diplomacy — a geopolitical battle in which China, Russia and the U.K. are also fully engaged.,center
European leaders have been on the defensive since Biden’s announcement, which they view as a shrewd — and somewhat maddening— public relations maneuver.,center
Although EU leaders had announced urgent plans to help India, Biden upstaged Europe, first by announcing donations to India of millions of doses of AstraZeneca vaccine and then by reversing course and endorsing a patent waiver.,center
India is a pharmaceutical manufacturing powerhouse and perhaps the country best positioned to capitalize on Biden’s plan.,center
Pressman, an appointee by outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden, made the remarks as Trump continued to shower Orbán with praise on the campaign trail.,center
BERLIN — Joe Biden may be riding high at home with approval ratings Donald Trump could only dream of, but that’s unlikely to help him much this week as he tries to win over a notoriously ornery constituency for any U.S. president: Europe.,center
Biden will address Europeans directly for the first time since taking office with a keynote scheduled for Friday at the Munich Security Conference.,center
The virtual appearance will be a homecoming of sorts for Biden, who for decades has been a regular at the annual affair — the Western security wonk’s answer to the World Economic Forum in Davos.,center
We’ll be back,” Biden famously told the conference two years ago, speaking after then-Vice President Mike Pence.,center
Biden was rewarded with a standing ovation, even though many in the audience doubted him.,center
Biden may have proved his skeptics wrong, but the doubts remain.,center
Misgivings like that one have been apparent ever since the November election that brought Biden’s triumph over Trump.,center
Pressured by Germany, the EU forged ahead with an investment deal with China in December, ignoring requests by the incoming Biden administration to at least wait a few weeks until it was up and running.,center
The trip, which turned into a PR disaster for the EU, came just as Biden wanted to show that his administration could build a united Western front against Russian leader Vladimir Putin.,center
The worsening spat between Washington and Berlin over Germany’s pursuit of the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline coupled with Biden’s “Made In America” initiative to protect U.S. industry from foreign imports have also put a damper on relations between the new administration and Europe.,center
In his Munich speech, Biden, who will also take part in a video conference with G7 leaders on Friday, will try to steer the transatlantic relationship off the rocky road it has been on and coax the Europeans back onside.,center
The world has changed since Biden was last in power as then-President Barack Obama’s vice president.,center
Biden is likely to be sensitive to those pressures for the simple reason that they also exist for the U.S. For all of Washington’s suspicions about China, America’s economic entanglement with China is no less profound.,center
A life-long believer in America’s role as the world’s organizing power, Biden has signaled in past speeches his conviction that the U.S. and Europe can quickly turn the page on the Trump era and return to the halcyon days of transatlantic cooperation.,center
That’s why bringing Europe back onside is essential for Biden if his foreign policy agenda is to succeed.,center
The good news for Biden is that while Europe may have drifted closer to China, it has yet to pull away from the U.S. Notwithstanding recent rumblings in Paris and some other European capitals that Europe should pursue “strategic autonomy” — that is to effectively decouple from Washington — such initiatives have so far gone nowhere, mainly as a result of the EU’s own divisions.,center
That’s why Biden’s biggest challenge this week isn’t to prove that a return to the past is in America’s interest, but in Europe’s.,center
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte will meet with U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington D.C. next Tuesday, the offices of both governments said late Thursday.,center
Biden and Rutte “will also discuss [their] cooperation on critical technologies and shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific,” according to the American statement.,center
The visit also comes amid strained trade relations between the European Union and the U.S., who are engaged in a growing trade dispute over the Biden administration’s plans to heavily subsidise investments in green industries and purchases such as American-made electric cars, which the EU sees as a protectionist measure.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden announced $7.9 billion in security assistance to Ukraine before meeting with its President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House.,center
“It has been a top priority of my administration to provide Ukraine with the support it needs to prevail,” Biden wrote in his statement Thursday.,center
Zelenskyy thanked Biden, saying, “We will use this assistance in the most efficient and transparent manner to achieve our major common goal: victory for Ukraine, just and lasting peace, and transatlantic security.”,center
According to Biden's statement, the U.S. will allocate $5.5 billion through his presidential drawdown authority to fund equipment for Ukraine and another $2.4 billion in security assistance to provide the country with additional air defense, uncrewed aerial systems and air-to-ground munitions, among other equipment.,center
Biden will also provide Ukraine with Joint Standoff Weapon long-range munitions to improve long-range strike capabilities, and the U.S. will also refurbish and provide Ukraine with an additional Patriot air defense battery and additional Patriot missiles.,center
“My message is clear: The United States will give Ukraine the support it needs to win this war,” Biden wrote at the end of his statement.,center
In an interview, Lucy Flores says she came forward now because she fears Joe Biden would make it harder for Democrats to contrast with Trump on the treatment of women.,center
The former Nevada lawmaker who accused Joe Biden of giving her an “awkward kiss” in 2014 said she decided to go public because she wanted to force Democrats to confront his inappropriate behavior as the former vice president decides to run for the White House.,center
“It’s so easy to Google ‘Creepy Biden’ and you get all these compilations of pictures and video evidence of young women and women looking very, very uncomfortable,” Lucy Flores, a former Nevada assemblywoman and 2014 candidate for lieutenant governor, told POLITICO.,center
Flores said she initially kept quiet about the incident — in which she said Biden approached her from behind at a political event, smelled her hair and kissed the back of her head without her permission — because of a “general fear of retribution and backlash and judgment and all the things that happen to women who speak out against powerful men.”,center
But the #MeToo movement and Biden’s serious consideration of a presidential run changed her mind.,center
Her friends and political allies in Nevada were talking to Biden and his associates about his potential bid this month.,center
And the pictures and video clips of Biden hugging women, caressing their hair and holding on to their shoulders in too-familiar ways began surfacing on social media.,center
Flores said the Democratic nominee will need to differentiate herself or himself from President Trump, whom she described “as a full-on sexual harasser, misogynist and probably sexual assaulter” who is far worse than Biden.,center
But Biden’s baggage makes it harder to draw a sharp break with Trump, Flores said.,center
Biden’s camp did not reply to the particulars of Flores’ new statements, but it did point to a new Medium post from Stephanie Carter, the wife of former Defense Secretary Ash Carter, who said a picture of Biden holding her by her shoulders at an event was innocent and that he “kept his hands on my shoulders as a means of offering his support.”,center
Previously, Biden’s aides have has issued two carefully worded statements about Flores’ accusations.,center
A slew of Democratic candidates for president said they believe Flores, while allies of Biden tried to discredit her.,center
Flores said Biden’s second statement was better than the first, but “by him saying that never ever did he believe his behavior was inappropriate is still a big problem because it’s really hard for me to believe that after so many years of the same type of behavior and so many pictures and so many videos that someone didn’t at some point didn’t say to him, ‘You should stop behaving this way.’”,center
Biden has not called Flores to discuss the matter, and she said she doesn’t expect him to.,center
Biden has sounded contrite before without following up.,center
But as of 2018, Hill told Elle magazine, Biden hadn’t called her.,center
‘Oh,’ we say, ‘is that Joe Biden coming to apologize?’”,center
Biden last week offered another public apology to Hill and expressed regret about the way her hearing was handled.,center
Flores said she knew Biden’s allies would attack her after she came forward, but she’s also been encouraged by the support she’s received.,center
A new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows just 44 percent of voters approve of Biden’s job performance, and 46 percent say he’s “mentally fit.”,center
URBANDALE, Iowa — One scorching, airless early evening in the middle of August, on the outskirts of Des Moines here at a place called Living History Farms, Joe Biden stood in front of an old yellow barn and talked to a couple hundred people about the past.,center
“I think that, uh, the behavior of this administration has awakened, uh, a whole new generation to get engaged in ways that they may not have gotten before,” Biden said, referring to President Donald Trump and the current tumult.,center
But at this mention of the equal rights amendment, somebody started to clap, and others followed suit, and the smattering of applause felt like an act of mercy — giving the characteristically discursive Biden a chance to reset and everybody else the opportunity to take a breath and maybe not think too hard about the fact that the former vice president had bungled by a decade the dates of two of the most jarring and consequential killings in modern American history.,center
There is an entire cohort of Biden supporters for whom his age — actual and perceived — is the very thing that recommends him,center
After Biden finished talking, he spent the better part of an hour mingling with the many who wanted to stick around for selfies.,center
A young staffer with a clipboard asked a man within my earshot if he wanted to sign up to commit to caucus for Biden.,center
“I think I did that in ’87.” The first time Biden ran for president — 32 years ago.,center
This event, like every Biden event, couldn’t help but highlight one of the defining realities of his 2020 candidacy: Next month, he turns 77 years old.,center
Even as fading poll numbers loosen his status as the favorite and the mounting impeachment fervor over Ukraine threatens to exact a collateral toll, Biden’s age remains an overarching issue.,center
It’s an issue because of the simple math: Only three presidents have served in their 70s — Trump, Ronald Reagan and Dwight Eisenhower — and no president ever has finished a term at the age Biden would begin his.,center
It’s an issue because of things Biden has said and done — suggesting, for instance, he thought he was in Vermont when he actually was in New Hampshire, dropping that wince-worthy phrase that his “time is up” in the first debate and oddly invoking a record player in the last debate.,center
It’s an issue because Biden himself has tried in sometimes awkward ways to keep it from being one, inviting a heckler to run with him during a parade and challenging a reporter to a wrestling match.,center
And it’s an issue because opponents, from Trump (“Sleepy Joe”) to those in his own party trying to knock him off, have made it an issue — from Eric Swalwell sayingit was time to “pass the torch” to Tim Ryan saying he’s “declining” to Julian Castro (dubiously) accusing him of “forgetting” things to Cory Booker dishing out readymade Republican attack ad fodder by bluntly declaring on CNN that “there’s a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden’s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling” and “there are definitely moments where you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder.” Even the famously gracious Jimmy Carter, who just turned 95, delivered a candid if unhelpful assessment last month when he said he didn’t believe he could have handled “the duties that I experienced when I was president” if he had been 80.,center
Many of Biden’s supporters are of a generation for which this might be the second or third presidential campaign of his they’ve supported | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for POLITICO Magazine,center
This isn’t just about Biden’s age — it’s about ours, and the tension between a vast cohort of Baby Boomers who have trained themselves to believe they’re only as old as they feel and a couple of impatient generations lined up behind them, wondering when they’re going to get a chance to take over.,center
All three of the top-polling Democrats, after all, are in their 70s, but it’s Biden, the centrist who advocates for a return to a pre-Trump time, who is getting dinged the most for his advanced age — not Elizabeth Warren, who wants “big, structural change” and turned 70 in June.,center
But there is an entire cohort of Biden supporters for whom his age — actual and perceived — is the very thing that recommends him.,center
After the tumult of the Trump years, these voters crave the experience and order and stability Biden promises.,center
For them, Biden is the beneficiary of shifting social and cultural notions that make it harder to pinpoint what it actually means to be old.,center
Joe Biden’s father died at 86.,center
That’s essentially what Biden’s repeatedly asked voters to do.,center
Biden was asked if he had thought about pledging to just one term to allay the concerns about his age.,center
I mean, you could die tomorrow — right now — talking to me! He could live to be a hundred.” Bruce Hoffmeier is the same age as Biden.,center

And at Living History Farms, I watched Biden keep working that rope line before turning to catch up with the man I’d overheard tell the young staffer that he’d committed to caucus better than three decades back.,center
Tom Rial of Des Moines was enrolled at the University of Northern Iowa, where he was the president of the student group for Biden.,center
Biden called a 24-year-old woman who asked about climate change “kiddo.” She said she found it “patronizing.”,center
Democrats just want to beat Trump, and polls still say they think Biden’s the best bet.,center
Also, the challenge for Mondale in the scenario in ’84 looks in retrospect like a version of what Biden’s opponents are dealing with now: He had to try to diminish Reagan while simultaneously showing something along the lines of deference.,center
Mondale couldn’t do it, and none of the younger 2020 candidates have managed it yet with Biden, either.,center
Last month in New Hampshire, in Laconia, on the top floor of “the oldest unaltered brick textile mill in the U.S.,” according to the adjacent historical marker, I watched Biden tell people the salary for a senator back when he was first elected was $42,000 a year, briefly mix up Reagan with Nixon, and refer to Charlottesville as Charlotte before correcting himself two and a half minutes later.,center
Almost eight months older than Biden, he’s still a state representative.,center
After Huot, for instance, I met Dr. Paul Sapir, 91, and his wife, Sylvia, 76, Rhode Island residents with a nearby summer home, and asked them open-endedly what they thought of Biden’s performance.,center

That evening, in nippy New Castle over on the Atlantic coast, a man stoodat the rear of the crowd in an oceanfront park and poked fun with a held-high sign welcoming Biden back to Vermont.,center
In the question-and-answer session after his talk, Biden called a 24-year-old woman who asked about climate change “kiddo.” She said she found it “patronizing.”,center
The next morning, at the state Democratic Party convention at the sports arena in downtown Manchester, Biden was the first of all the presidential candidates to take the stage.,center
Biden adlibbed.,center
Biden remains the candidate to beat — in spite of the softening of his standing in some polls.,center
Biden opted not to show up.,center
Ryan, 46, pointed to “a lack of clarity” in the way Biden speaks.,center
“I’ve seen military reports about what’s going to happen in the next 25 years — when, as another one of my colleagues says, I will still be younger than the president of the United States.” And Castro, days before he would unleash toward Biden his “forgetting” fusillade, was explicit.,center
Biden, however, remains the candidate to beat — in spite of the softening of his standing in some polls.,center
But he warned of “the danger of trying to go after Biden.”,center
“There is,” former top Obama strategist David Axelrod emailed, “a lot of affection and respect among Democrats for Biden.,center
And in an environment in which defeating Trump is the urgent concern of many Democrats, Biden seems like the safest, least risky choice.”,center

Buttigieg, who was five years old when Biden first ran for president, bounded to his spot behind the stump, dressed in his uniform of dark slacks and a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up.,center
Then, though, led to the stump by a stomping, gyrating, instrument-waggling troupe from Florence, the energetic marching band from that city’s Wilson High, Biden was ready to respond.,center
Biden built to a crescendo of his own.,center
WASHINGTON — Predictions of a Joe Biden pile-on were spot on.,center
Those who thought Kamala Harris might “take it easy”on Biden, as he suggested when they met on stage, were wrong.,center
The debate on Wednesday will be remembered more than anything as the night Biden woke up.,center
Last month in Miami, Biden appeared unsteady as Harris ripped into him on issues of race.,center
On Wednesday, Biden still tripped over his words and struggled with recall at times.,center
The main impediment to Biden’s path to the nomination has always been the centrist profile he built during a decadeslong career in Washington.,center
Hewing to a general election audience on immigration, Biden said, “People should have to get in line” to come into the country — a line that progressive activists aren’t going to like.,center
And swiping at Harris on health care — and, by extension, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who were not on stage Wednesday — Biden said, “If you noticed, there is no talk about the fact that the plan in 10 years will cost $3 trillion.,center
It’s not clear Biden did anything to expand his base of support.,center
And for the moderate lane he occupies, Biden hit his notes.,center
It was billed as a rematch between Biden and Harris.,center
But Booker seized Harris’ role as Biden’s chief antagonist on Wednesday, and he will likely benefit from the role.,center
Even Biden, in a slip, called him the “future president.”,center
Where Harris hit Biden on issues of race last month, Booker seized on his record on criminal justice.,center
He criticized Biden for his “phony rhetoric,” and suggested he had helped to destroy “communities like mine.”,center
Biden, by raising questions about Booker’s own record as mayor of Newark, N.J., fought Booker in a way he did not muster last month against Harris.,center
If Biden was the chief target for his rivals on Wednesday, Harris was a close second.,center
But the resulting back-and-forth wasn’t just a two-person colloquy between Harris and Biden.,center
Bennet showed passion, and Kirsten Gillibrand took her best swing against Biden.,center
Biden hinted at de Blasio’s likely fate on Wednesday.,center
After Hizzoner applauded Biden for his opposition to the renegotiated NAFTA trade deal, de Blasio said, “You know what?,center
“Well, I tell you what,” Biden responded.,center
Biden, on the other hand, will continue to be pressed on how his plan to improve Obamacare would still leave millions uninsured.,center
Ankara hasn’t seen sufficient progress from Sweden to support its application to join NATO, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan warned U.S. President Joe Biden in a phone call Sunday ahead of a summit of NATO leaders this week.,center
Biden has thrown his support behind a push to get a deal on Sweden at the meeting in Vilnius.,center
Biden and Erdoğan also discussed the sale of U.S. F-16 fighter jets to Turkey in the call, with the Turkish president “noting that it is not correct to associate” Ankara’s request for F-16 aircraft with Sweden’s NATO membership bid, according to the statement.,center
Erdoğan and Biden agreed to meet face-to-face in Vilnius and discuss Turkey-U.S. bilateral relations and regional issues in detail, according to the Turkish statement.,center
But in some ways, life was simpler for the French president before Joe Biden entered the White House.,center
But as he prepares to meet Biden for the first time at the G7 summit in Cornwall, England, this weekend, the French president finds the leading position has been retaken by his American counterpart, an avowed champion of multilateralism.,center
That presents Macron with a more subtle challenge: how to work with Biden on their many common endeavors while holding onto the global leadership role he enjoys and France expects, as well as trying to preserve a distinctively French and European position on some issues.,center
So far, Macron's response to that challenge has revealed irritation at the credit Biden has received for his international initiatives, as well as apparent attempts at one-upmanship, adjustments to the U.S. administration's ways of operating and relief at again having a more reasonable partner in Washington.,center
Even before Biden took office, Macron seemed to be trying to preemptively set elements of the international agenda.,center
Similarly, France backed an EU decision to push ahead with an investment deal with China just weeks before Biden's inauguration — even though the U.S. president's team had made clear it wanted the EU to wait.,center
Since Biden took office, Macron has frequently declared that it's the U.S. that's catching up with Europe on climate, biodiversity and vaccine solidarity — pillars of the new global multilateral agenda that Europeans had had to build without Trump's support.,center
Macron has also been keen to preserve a distinct European approach to the world's biggest issues, even at the risk of being perceived to be one-upping Biden.,center
In April, a few days before Biden’s Leaders’ Summit on Climate, Macron hosted a tripartite summit videocall with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the same issue.,center
The official French line was that Macron had informed the U.S. of his plans to hold such talks, in order to try to get China to increase its climate commitments, when Biden’s Special Envoy for Climate John Kerry visited Macron in Paris.,center
But, to some at least, the Elysée seemed to be allowing the Chinese government to set the narrative around the summit and steal a march on Biden — Beijing announced the meeting ahead of the French, while Kerry was in Shanghai for a round of talks.,center
In May, Biden overshadowed a European Council summit in Portugal with an announcement that he was in favor of waiving patents on COVID-19 vaccines in order to facilitate access for poorer countries.,center
Asked at a press conference if Biden had claimed moral leadership on COVID-19 vaccine solidarity by supporting waiving patents, Macron was visibly irked.,center
Macron expressed support for waiving patents for vaccines to help end the coronavirus pandemic, while Biden was getting ready to announce plans to purchase 500 million doses of BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines to distribute to other nations.,center
On a personal level, less is riding on Macron's relationship with Biden than was on the line with Trump.,center
Biden governs in a more collegial style than Trump and delegates much more to senior officials.,center
At first glance, Macron, the upstart wunderkind with little folksy appeal, and the down-to-earth Biden — who has been in politics longer than the French president has been alive — are very different.,center
On Thursday, former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden will launch a new political action committee (PAC), American Possibilities, giving him a way to support Democratic political candidates while keeping his own options open for a potential 2020 presidential run.,center
Biden has hired Greg Schultz, his political director during his second term as vice president, as the executive director of the PAC.,center
“Thinking big is stamped into the DNA of the American soul,” Biden wrote in a post that will go live on Medium in the morning.,center
Though he repeatedly bashed Donald Trump on the campaign trail last year and again at an appearance in New Hampshire in late April, Biden has been just as critical of his own party’s failings.,center
Though the PAC is geared toward helping other candidates, the website launching with it is centered on photos of Biden: holding a baby on the campaign trail, seated waving in front of a giant American flag, and locking arms with Rep.,center
“I would like to see a more forthright position coming from the Biden administration that says there’s no reason why Ukraine shouldn’t be fighting back,” former U.S. envoy to NATO Kurt Volker told POLITICO.,center
But I don’t think we’re going to see Biden authorizing the use of U.S. missiles to strike at Russian airfields, although the British might be allowed to proceed without U.S. objection,” he added.,center
And according to officials in Kyiv, it’s the fear of this happening that’s been one of the factors driving the Biden administration to reconsider the restrictions, including on U.S. ATACMS and British Storm Shadows.,center
And while Biden and British Prime Minister Kier Starmer brushed off Putin’s threats on Friday, the U.S. administration still appears to be trapped between two worries — fear of how Moscow might respond if Western-supplied missiles start striking Russian airfields, and wreck projects for peace talks to get going, and alarm over the prospect of Ukraine losing power.,center
Biden critics argue he’s being overly cautious.,center
He expressed disappointment at emerging signs that Biden may agree to Britain’s Storm Shadows being used for attacks on Russian airfields but not American ATACMS, and he blamed the U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan for the caution.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden will not attend the upcoming Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland, a decision that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has described as a gift to Russia.,center
The Ukrainians had hoped that Biden would put in an appearance, given his plans to attend France’s D-Day anniversary celebrations and a meeting of G7 leaders in Italy in the days leading up to the summit.,center
Instead, Biden appears set to attend a Hollywood fundraising event planned for the summit weekend.,center
“The vice president will underscore the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to supporting Ukraine’s effort to secure a just and lasting peace, based on Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and the principles of the U.N. Charter,” the White House said.,center
“I believe that the peace summit needs President Biden, and other leaders need President Biden because they will look at the U.S.’s reaction,” Zelenskyy said at a press conference in Brussels last week.,center
No matter who represents the U.S. at the peace summit, it can’t be said that Washington and President Biden haven’t been there for Ukraine, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said at a briefing last week.,center
“From the very beginning of this conflict, no other leader has done as much and continues to do as much as President Biden does to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself against Russian aggression,” Kirby said.,center
NEW YORK — This is not the Joe Biden that Europe wanted.,center
After he defeated Donald Trump, many Europeans hailed Biden as a conquering hero — the quiet, cool kid who kicked the loudmouth bully out of the playground.,center
What EU leaders expected was the Biden they had taken pictures with on his countless visits overseas, and who regularly attended the annual Munich Security Conference.,center
The transatlanticist Biden.,center
The Europeanist Biden.,center
The mulitateralist Biden.,center
When Biden, at a special virtual Munich Security Conference convened to celebrate the start of his presidency, declared “America is back,” European leaders didn’t think he meant back to the arrogant exceptionalism that has often defined Washington’s approach to the EU and toward NATO.,center
But on Friday, Biden closed out his first high-level U.N. General Assembly week by assembling the leaders of “the Quad” — Australia, India, Japan and the U.S. — at the White House.,center
By showcasing his focus on Asia, and excluding the Europeans, Biden made it abundantly clear that rather than leading a rejuvenated Western alliance, with Berlin, Paris and Brussels as major partners, he plans to lead smaller, regional alliances focused on U.S. interests.,center
At a news conference on Friday to sum up his own work during the high-level U.N. week, Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, started by talking about how much of his visit was consumed by dealing with the fallout from a surprise announcement by Biden of a new Indo-Pacific strategic alliance with the U.K. and Australia, which also included the cancellation of a giant contract for Australia to purchase French-built submarines.,center
Noting a phone call between Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron to begin smoothing over the controversy, Borrell said “the process had not been well handled, could have been better handled.,center
But while Macron notably made some gains in that conversation, winning what appeared to be Biden’s support for the EU to build its own stronger military capabilities, the entire episode only confirmed the sinking feeling among European leaders that Biden is not going to be the president, or the partner, they hoped for.,center
On Friday, European Council President Charles Michel, who at a news conference in New York earlier in the week accused Biden of showing a lack of loyalty and lack of transparency, delivered his formal speech to the U.N. General Assembly, which had been reshaped to put added emphasis on the need for the EU’s strategic independence, especially in the Indo-Pacific.,center
Many EU officials and diplomats have chalked up the recent diplomatic feud over the Indo-Pacific to Washington’s, and Biden’s, obsessive focus on China, as well as to a desire by the White House to begin resurrecting its international reputation after the rushed and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.,center
I don’t understand it at all,” adding that she saw Biden as “very loyal.”,center
Adding to the difficulties between Brussels and the White House are the customary challenges that national governments face in figuring out who to deal with in the EU, as well as the continuing absence of a U.S. ambassador because of delays with Senate confirmation of Biden’s nominee, Mark Gitenstein.,center
(Biden’s nominee to be ambassador to France, Denise Campbell Bauer, is also still awaiting Senate approval).,center
After the Biden-Macron call, the U.S. national security adviser spoke to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s chief of staff, Bjoern Seibert, and Michel’s chief, Frédéric Bernard, traveled to Washington from New York to see Jake Sullivan in person.,center
Some EU officials said they hoped France could leverage Biden’s support for a stronger and more independent EU military posture, using Washington’s backing to help persuade some EU countries, especially in Eastern Europe, who have long opposed so-called “strategic autonomy” for fear it would undermine NATO and weaken U.S. commitment.,center
How strongly Biden intended to endorse European strategic sovereignty is not clear.,center
At best, it seems Biden would not be an obstacle, but it is far from clear he will actively promote Macron’s goals.,center
Meanwhile, Biden’s comments from February now ring a bit hollow to many European ears.,center
“It comes down to this,” Biden had declared.,center
“The U.S. has announced clearly in President Biden, but also President Trump and also President Obama, their will of withdrawing and not being continuously fighting the wars of others,” he said.,center
European Commission president’s close relationship with Joe Biden could be a liability.,center
In particular, when it comes to the war in Ukraine, she owes a great deal of her success to her close cooperation with U.S. President Joe Biden and his team.,center
The partnership started months before Russian tanks rolled on Ukraine, when Biden warned von der Leyen about a possible invasion during her visit to the White House in November 2021 and the two began to coordinate on a complex package of sanctions and export controls that would be ready to go when the invasion began.,center
When Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act caused European governments to worry their companies could be put at a disadvantage, it was von der Leyen who worked with the White House to minimize the impact on the European economy.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a “crazy SOB” was an attempt to act like a “Hollywood cowboy,” the Kremlin said Thursday.,center
Biden made the remarks during a fundraiser Wednesday night in San Francisco, saying the U.S. is always forced to worry about nuclear conflict, despite climate change being “the existential threat to humanity.”,center
“It is clear that Mr. Biden demonstrates behavior in the style of a Hollywood cowboy for the sake of domestic political interests,” Peskov added.,center
Peskov claimed that Putin never makes insulting statements toward Biden.,center
On the other hand, he pointed out that he had a “personal relationship” with Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump.,center
Biden has not held back in expressing his criticism of Putin since Russia invaded Ukraine two years ago.,center
SAN DIEGO — U.S. President Joe Biden has accepted a formal invitation from Rishi Sunak to visit Northern Ireland to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement next month.,center
Biden replied: “Twenty-five years?,center
With Irish antecedents, Biden pays close attention to developments in Northern Ireland, and had made clear his displeasure at the standoff over the protocol.,center
Sunak later said Biden had invited him to make a return visit to Washington in June.,center
In her recent World View column “Europe’s anxieties about Biden are really anxieties about itself” (September 6), Harvard’s Nathalie Tocci tried to cheer up Europeans who are let down by U.S. President Joe Biden’s hasty and unilateral withdrawal from Afghanistan.,center
A wave of cyberattacks have crippled U.S. gasoline supplies and hit its grocery shelves, and U.S. President Joe Biden has promised to put a stop to it.,center
Biden is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva on Wednesday in what is likely to be a tense meeting, but the White House is still battling to secure a commitment from Russia to do more to rein in the attacks.,center
"Ultimately, we don’t judge Russia — the Russian government — was responsible for the ransomware attacks, but we have said it is Russia’s sovereign obligation to deal with it," Jake Sullivan, Biden's top national security adviser, told reporters on Sunday.,center
"To the extent what Vladimir Putin wants is a common commitment that no country — neither Russia nor the United States nor anyone else — will harbor cyber criminals, whether ransomware attackers or otherwise, Joe Biden is all in for that," Sullivan said.,center
The Geneva summit is only the latest venue where Biden will highlight the danger of ransomware attacks.,center
United States President Joe Biden starts 2024 in circumstances that any incumbent would envy.,center
Yes, of course, there are major issues still to be tackled — most notably, surging numbers of desperate people trying to enter the country in search of a better life; and Biden’s age is a problem for many voters.,center
After Russia’s full-scale invasion nearly two years ago, Biden and his team marshalled an impressive coalition in support of Ukraine — with more than $200 billion in military and economic aid, as well as devastating  financial and economic sanctions on Russia.,center
Biden has asked for more than $60 billion in aid for this year, but Congress has failed to act.,center
However, this is hardly the only foreign policy challenge Biden will face early in the new year.,center
Aside from supporting Israel, Biden’s most immediate objective has been to make sure the war in Gaza doesn’t escalate, and so far, he has succeeded.,center
The resulting clash could make the Gaza war seem minor in comparison — leaving Biden’s overriding goal to prevent regional war in tatters.,center
Finally, there is Taiwan, where presidential elections in mid-January may determine whether another major crisis will descend on Biden’s desk early in the new year.,center
But while he told Biden in their November meeting that there’s no timeline for this objective, he has also said that if Taiwan resists or drags its feet on unification, China reserves the right to use force.,center
Foreign policy doesn’t usually affect electoral politics and outcomes in the U.S. But any of these crises — let alone all three simultaneously — would pose a significant challenge to Biden’s electoral prospects.,center
Biden Jr., at the age of 77 years, nine months, and 10 days has been alive for just a shade under one-third of the entire history of the United States as an independent nation.,center
One way to think about that is: Biden really is quite old.,center
20, the day Biden will accept the Democratic nomination in his bid to become the oldest occupant of the White House — he would be 78 days older on his first day in office than Ronald Reagan was on his last—it is worth holding the subject up to the light from both angles.,center
How old is Biden?,center
When Biden arrived in the U.S. Senate at age 30 on Jan.,center
Biden’s comparatively advanced age, however, is a useful lens for viewing the comparative youth of the country he hopes to lead.,center
Based on rough demographic estimates, Biden’s life has overlapped with well over 80 percent of the people who have ever lived in America since 1776.,center
Imagine that Joe Biden as an infant was bounced on the knee of someone who was the same age then that he is now.,center
Albert Henry Woolson, the final documented veteran of the Civil War did not die (at age 106 in Duluth) until Biden was 13 years old, in 1956.,center
Peter Mills, the last person reliably known to have been born into slavery did not die (at age 110 in Pittsburgh) until 1972, when Biden was in the closing weeks of his first Senate campaign.,center
Biden was born two years after Robert Zimmerman, not yet known as Bob Dylan, seven days before Jimi Hendrix, and two months before Janis Joplin.,center
Unlike Hendrix and Joplin, Biden was not at Woodstock, and it is unlikely he was tempted to attend.,center
Perhaps these data points cry out for what journalists call a “so-what paragraph.” Here it is: Many icons of Baby Boomer culture, like Bob Dylan, were not actually Baby Boomers themselves, and neither is Biden.,center
This means that Biden, if he wins, would be the only person in history to become president from a distinct generation of people who were too young to be in World War II but were already emphatically into adulthood by the time of Vietnam, and the political and cultural upheavals of the 1960s.,center
Until earlier this year, when Biden and Bernie Sanders — born three months before Pearl Harbor in 1941—were the last candidates standing for the Democratic nomination, it looked virtually certain the presidency would skip an entire generation.,center
Biden, after all, is just 43 months older than Trump, and 45 months older than Clinton.,center

Biden’s photograph in the 1965 University of Delaware looks like most of the young men of his class, and the 20 years before that: A smiling, genial fellow in jacket and tie, with neatly trimmed, well-combed hair.,center
Sociologists have labeled the bloc of Americans who came of age after World War II but before the tumult of the 1960s the “Silent Generation.” As a politician, the voluble Biden was hardly known for silence (though his general election strategy during a pandemic involves talking far less than Trump).,center
That came with the huge surge of young people born just in the wake of Biden and his peers.,center
This history suggests one opportunity for Biden if he becomes president.,center
By coincidence, the same year Biden came to Congress the Gallup Organization began measuring public confidence in major institutions.,center
The hazard is that Biden’s values will seem irrelevant or ineffectual in a political culture gravitating to young leaders like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who shot to fame by defying institutional traditions and harnessing social media.,center
Biden was an adolescent before televisions in living rooms became commonplace, had been in the Senate for a decade before office computers arrived, and nearly a quarter-century before email.,center
Biden’s trajectory also invites reflection on the optics of history: Are leaders becoming less capacious figures, or is that an illusion of time?,center
Biden was born when dominating figures—FDR, Churchill—bestrode the world stage.,center

Biden’s life takes on epic stature primarily when viewed through the prism of tenure.,center
As Senate historical data compiled by my colleague Matthew Choi reveals, Biden in 36 years as senator and eight as vice president (who breaks ties in the Senate) served with nearly 20 percent of the 1,984 people who have ever served in the Senate.,center
Biden’s career, however, is at once a reminder that things do change and that we haven’t really been immersed in the effort to change for all that long.,center
Nancy Landon Kassebaum — the Kansas Republican who was the first women elected to a full Senate term without having a husband who previously served in Congress—didn’t join Biden in the Senate until he had been there for five years.,center
Biden was 24 in the “long, hot summer” of urban racial riots of 1967.,center
Martin Luther King Jr. was 13 when Biden was born and Biden was 25 when King died.,center
Biden was 13 when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on the bus.,center
Even after 36 years in the Senate, Biden had served with only three African Americans.,center
That is how many are in the chamber today, a number that will drop to two if Biden and Harris win.,center
Biden’s personal story is long, and he is trying to write himself into a national story that, one hopes, is still in its early chapters.,center
It’s no secret that most Europeans have been praying Joe Biden would win the presidency; he may yet, but not with anything like a landslide.,center
Yes, transatlantic relations would inevitably improve under a Biden presidency after the bitternerness of the Trump years (how could they not?).,center
Not only will Biden lack a strong mandate if he wins by the skin of his teeth, but Congress looks likely to remain divided, with the Democrats controlling the House of Representatives and the Republicans in charge in the Senate.,center
The technical term for that constellation is “gridlock.” It will force Biden into the same corner that Trump faced for the past two years and that bedeviled much of Barack Obama’s time in office.,center
That’s why European leaders were hoping Biden would win by a landslide with the Democrats riding his coattails in Congress.,center
A strong Biden win could have allowed Washington and its European allies to pursue the kind of sweeping transatlantic agenda many think is essential in order to renew and redefine the alliance, especially in the face of the growing challenge posed by China.,center
At the back of Europe’s mind will also be the question of what happens four years from now, even if Biden wins this time.,center
Given his age, Biden could well choose to be a one-term president.,center
Yet that issue could remain a source of tension with a Biden administration, which, like Trump, is keen to focus more on China in the coming years.,center
A Biden administration would likely follow Trump’s policy of pushing Europe to take on more responsibility for its own security, albeit with a less aggressive tone.,center
The announcement comes after U.S. President Joe Biden agreed to supply antipersonnel land mines to Ukraine on Wednesday, and two days after he lifted restrictions on use of American-supplied long-range missiles on Russian territory.,center
U.S. Democratic candidate Joe Biden has promised to increase assistance to Ukraine, including access to lethal weapons.,center
U.S. Democratic candidate Joe Biden, meanwhile, has promised to increase assistance to Ukraine, including access to lethal weapons.,center
“From what I can tell, most Ukrainians are holding their breath and hoping that Biden wins,” said Brian Bonner, the veteran editor of the Kyiv Post.,center
“Biden knows Ukraine quite well and was here as vice president six or seven times … [as part of] the Obama administration.”,center
Ukrainians hope they’ll benefit from Biden’s previous experience in Ukraine and his understanding that “defeating Russia also means defeating corruption in Ukraine,” according to Bonner.,center
Rather than widespread support for Biden, it might be more accurate to say that a majority in Ukraine are actively worried about Trump’s policies, said Volodymyr Fesenko, who heads the political consultancy company, Penta and previously advised the governments of former Presidents Petro Poroshenko and Viktor Yuschenko.,center
A victory for Biden, Ukrainians argue, would bring back a sense of normality to relations that have become increasingly unpredictable over the past four years.,center
Privately, though, Ukrainian diplomats, intelligence and military officials have discussed the possibility that if Putin sees Trump lose in November, he might unleash his forces to snatch more Ukrainian territory in the period before Biden is sworn in.,center
A victory for Biden, Ukrainians argue, would bring back a sense of normality to relations that have become increasingly unpredictable over the past four years.,center
Europe’s press was stunned by Joe Biden’s “near-catastrophic” performance in the first U.S. presidential debate of 2024 in the early hours of Friday morning.,center
The Continent’s leading websites splashed with scathing reactions and commentary about the showdown between Biden and former U.S. President Donald Trump, with many singling out Biden for criticism after a rocky display in which he struggled with detail and delivered halting lines.,center
Swedish broadcaster SVT declared Biden’s showing “near-catastrophic,” while Finland’s Yle called his performance a “disaster.” Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra said Biden acted “confused” with a “hoarse voice,” and Poland’s Onet declared that Trump “put [Biden] on his back,” calling it “sad to watch.”,center
France’s Le Monde called Biden’s stumbling over his words a “shipwreck,” adding that Trump “was able to roll out lies without contradiction,” while Britain’s Economist said Biden’s “horrific debate performance casts his entire candidacy into doubt.”,center
The Kyiv Independent said Biden had unnerved his party with his “shaky” performance.,center
Anthony Gardner says Biden should follow Trump example and dismiss all politically appointed ambassadors on Inauguration Day.,center
Anthony Gardner, the former U.S. ambassador to the EU, urged President-elect Joe Biden and his transition team to issue an order ousting President Donald Trump’s ambassadors on January 20 — just as Trump on his own Inauguration Day dismissed all of Barack Obama’s diplomats.,center
Gardner was the point-man in Europe for Biden’s presidential campaign, and is well-connected to the incoming administration.,center
His family friendship with Biden’s nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, dates back more than 50 years.,center
The Ukrainian leader will have quite the itinerary, beginning with a speech at the United Nations General Assembly and then a separate meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden.,center
“Volodymyr Zelenskyy will present his victory plan to [Biden].,center
Besides Biden, Zelenskyy plans to meet with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Congressional representatives from both parties, and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Nykyforov added.,center
The White House confirmed Biden will meet Zelenskyy Sept.,center
Earlier in August, Zelenskyy announced his intention to present his victory plan to both presidential candidates as well as to Biden.,center
Like U.S. President Joe Biden in 2020, Starmer capitalized on a demand from voters desperate to just end the madness.,center
The question, now that Starmer is preparing to govern, is whether he will be able to keep making boring work — or whether, like Biden before him, it will come back to bite him.,center
After four years of U.S. President Donald Trump — who spent his term in office ripping up established norms, provoking allies, ditching international agreements and getting himself impeached — a majority of the country rallied behind the unstated theme of the Biden 2020 campaign: Make the White House Boring Again.,center
In office, Biden largely continued to dole out the same medicine, trying to cool Washington’s feverous partisanship by reaching across the aisle.,center
White House aides — and the president himself — took satisfaction in contrasting the successful results of Biden’s work with Trump’s failed, flashier efforts.,center
“He promised ‘Infrastructure Week’ every week for four years and never built a damn thing,” Biden said this spring to a group of laughing union members while touting the launch of 50,000 projects due to one of the signature domestic spending laws he signed.,center
“Americans overwhelmingly chose President Biden’s competent leadership over Trump’s chaos and weakness,” said Charles Lutvak, campaign spokesman, speaking before the U.S. president’s disastrous debate performance kicked off another round of concerns about Biden’s age, leading to calls he should step down to make way for another candidate.,center
Even before Biden became interesting for all the wrong reasons, his poll numbers were already slipping, with surveys predicting a defeat in November against a politician whose ability to dominate a news cycle — good or bad — is unparalleled in modern American history.,center
“We wanted to let tired Americans think about the White House less,” said one former senior Biden campaign official not authorized to speak publicly about internal conversations.,center
Recently, White House and campaign advisers have grown frustrated with how difficult it has been to take their message — of Biden being the competent adult in the room — and break through the cluttered, fractured media landscape, according to three officials not authorized to publicly discuss internal conversations.,center
Part of the problem has been the messenger himself: Biden, like Starmer, isn’t the most dynamic communicator.,center
But Biden’s team has also run up against the short attention span of a public — and political media — that all too often, the officials feel, is enraptured by whatever controversy Trump spins off next.,center
“The key for Biden is to remind moderates and his own base just how much the opposite of stable Trump is,” said Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University.,center
The cruel irony for the Biden team is that the president is currently monopolizing the media and public’s attention — but not for the reasons they had hoped.,center
Just as Trump has returned to upend Biden’s reelection plans, so Britain’s populist right — which delivered the 2016 vote for Brexit — may not lie sleeping for long.,center
DAVOS, Switzerland — Senator Chris Coons is open to imposing conditions on future military aid to Israel, a sign that pressure is growing on U.S. President Joe Biden to punish the Middle Eastern ally over its deadly ground assault in Gaza.,center
Coons’ stance, articulated for the first time during an interview with POLITICO, could prove a headache for Biden.,center
“There are conditions on our aid,” he said, alluding to the numerous laws and policies surrounding arms transfers, including a Biden administration directive restricting transfers to foreign countries when it is more likely than not that it would lead to a serious violation of human rights or humanitarian law.,center
Israel insists it’s about to turn toward a less intense, more targeted phase of military operations — a shift the Biden administration hopes will save lives in Gaza and alleviate suffering for the enclave’s 2.3 million people.,center
U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken will soon arrive in glitzy Davos and are expected to discuss Biden's plans for addressing the Israel-Hamas war.,center
The United States is sending more air defense missiles to Kyiv as part of another batch of military aid confirmed on the eve of Ukraine's Independence Day, U.S. President Joe Biden said late Friday.,center
After speaking with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Biden said almost 400 individuals and organizations would also be sanctioned as part of efforts to punish those responsible for Russia's invasion.,center
"Make no mistake: Russia will not prevail in this conflict," Biden said.,center
Vice President Joe Biden several times criticized what he called an Israeli government that causes “overwhelming frustration” in a speech that seemed to rule out the chances of a final year peace push from the Obama administration.,center
“The present course Israel’s on is not one that’s likely to secure its existence as a Jewish, democratic state— and we have to make sure that happens,” Biden said, in a speech to the annual gala dinner of the left-leaning J Street held in Washington.,center
But Monday, Biden went harder at Netanyahu as he sketched out a reality he said that’s left him feeling that “the path for peace is shrouded.”,center
“There is, at the moment, no political will among Israelis and Palestinians to move forward with serious negotiations,” Biden said.,center
Biden kicked off his remarks by praising Stav Shaffir, a 30-year-old member of the Israeli Knesset from the left whom he said was a “flashback” to his own election to the Senate at the age of 29.,center
“May your views once again begin to have a majority opinion in the Knesset,” Biden said.,center
Biden said his trip to the Middle East last month, when he met with both Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, had left him with a sense of pessimism.,center
Biden said his meetings with the two leaders did not leave him “feeling encouraged about the prospects of peace.”,center
Speaking ahead of Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry expressed more optimism, saying his efforts continue, but stressing the need for a two-state solution, and quickly: “Anything else will not be Jewish, and will not be democratic,” he said.,center
Whatever happens, Biden said, the United States has a vital role to play, and organizations like J Street, which “proves there’s no contradiction between being progressive and pro-Israeli,” are at the forefront.,center
“We are Israel’s maybe not-only friend,” Biden said, “but only absolutely certain friend.”,center
But Joseph Biden’s firm public commitment that he would select a woman as his running mate in the event he stays atop the Democratic race and is the party’s 2020 nominee is historically unprecedented: No major candidate has ever made such a pledge based on demographic characteristics, nor has one narrowed the field of potential vice presidential nominees this early in the year, several months before the decision is usually made.,center
Bernie Sanders, the only other candidate still competing in an election cycle in which debate stages once had to accommodate as many as 20 candidates over two nights, matched Biden’s hard pledge with a soft one, saying that “in all likelihood” he would also name a women as long as she shares his progressive views and that “my very strong tendency to move in that direction.”,center
The moment showed Biden signaling that his thoughts are already far advanced into the politics of the general election.,center
In giving up a measure of latitude about his choice, Biden also seemed to be suggesting something about how he views himself and how he wants other Democrats to view him: Not necessarily as the most commanding figure or someone clinging to personal prerogatives, but the sturdiest vessel to accommodate the party’s disparate demographic and ideological blocs.,center
Sturdy, in fact, seemed to be the motif for Biden’s two-hour performance, held without an audience at CNN’s Washington studio.,center
The last time Biden was on a debate stage was two weeks ago, in South Carolina.,center
History has pivoted in those two weeks, both for Biden and the country.,center
That pivot imposed some new questions on Biden and Sanders both as they entered the debate.,center
Even so, Biden opened the evening with a sober tone and factual recitation of measures he wants to fight the pandemic, including expanded testing via drive-through locations in every state, enlisting the military to help expand the pool of hospital beds, and quick action on spending to help people who have lost jobs and to offset the deadening effect on the economy.,center
Biden appeared more relaxed in a two-person contest, compared to earlier debates when he often receded in the noise or gave answers that bordered on unintelligible.,center
Biden was plainly eager to propitiate progressives, offering words of praise for departed candidate Elizabeth Warren and noting that he had spoken with her this week in support of her effort to modify a bankruptcy law that Biden helped pass in 2005.,center
Biden’s pledge to pick a woman as running mate, though plainly planned and not spontaneous, came during a rebuttal to Sanders, who said he intended a cabinet that “will look like America,” and boasted of his superior record on abortion rights and affordable childcare for working women.,center
Biden said in reply that he intended to name a black woman to the Supreme Court, as well as a woman to be his vice president: “There are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow.”,center
Biden repeated and at times intensified his frequent criticism of Sanders’ plans for such things as mandatory Medicare for All as too expensive and unworkable.,center
The Vermont senator came eager to debate his ideological arguments—especially on curbing corporate power, expanding health care, and mobilizing to fight climate change—and said he worries that Biden would have problems mobilizing young people in a general election against President Donald Trump.,center
But he did not try to light up Biden in sharply personal ways, in the fashion that Warren did successfully against former candidate Michael Bloomberg in the two previous debates.,center
Instead, Sanders portrayed Biden as well-intentioned but timid.,center
On climate change, for instance, he told Biden: “I know your heart is in the right place, but this requires dramatic, bold action.,center
This is hardly the kind of language that is impossible to walk back, or that gets in the way of an eventual endorsement, which Sanders says he will give to Biden if his own comeback plans don’t materialize.,center
Sanders peevishly needled Biden for a decade ago backing the Bowles-Simpson budget commission, which contemplated curbing the growth in spending for Social Security, Medicare, and veterans benefits.,center
Biden denied backing the commission, or any plans to cut popular entitlements.,center
That may well suit Biden just fine.,center
There was nothing over two hours of debate that seemed to fundamentally change the trajectory of the race, and that trajectory right now is favoring Biden.,center
London hopes to distinguish itself from Brussels, whose new investment deal with Beijing has gone down badly with the Biden team.,center
LONDON — In the race to be Joe Biden’s best friend in Europe, the U.K. has a plan — to be different on China.,center
While Wednesday’s inauguration of the 46th president of the United States will spell the end of Donald Trump’s blame-China-for-everything approach, early signals from Joe Biden’s transition team are that Washington will not be going soft on Beijing — and doesn’t want allies to either.,center
Officials in Boris Johnson’s government hope their mixture of toughness and foreign policy pragmatism will rhyme with Biden's — and set them apart from Brussels, Berlin and Paris.,center
Even so, U.K. officials say their approach stands in contrast to the EU, which, as the U.K.’s former national security adviser Mark Sedwill noted in an article in the Daily Mail on the eve of Biden’s inauguration, "rushed through" a new investment deal with China days before the new president takes office.,center
The deal went ahead despite Biden's incoming National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan requesting that the EU take the U.S.'s "common concerns" into account — something Biden's team are "deeply unhappy about," according to Sedwill.,center
While Biden’s opposition to Brexit and previous critical comments about Boris Johnson have been much-discussed as reasons why the “special relationship” might suffer, U.K. officials have been at pains to point out how — on many matters of substance — London is much more in tune with Biden than it ever was with Trump.,center
Climate change, the promotion of democratic values and the U.K.’s willingness to back up good diplomatic intentions with defense spending are all areas that U.K. diplomats have highlighted to counterparts in Biden’s team, officials said.,center
U.K. officials are pitching the country as a partner for Biden in helping to build those international alliances.,center
With Biden’s foreign policy agenda emphasizing the strengthening of democratic alliances after an era of Trumpist unilateralism, the U.K. also has two major international events in 2021 to ram home its usefulness as a convenor of like-minded nations, hosting both the G7 summit in June and COP26 U.N. climate change meeting in November.,center
The U.K.'s stated priorities for the meeting had Biden’s foreign policy goals plainly in sight, said Sophia Gaston, director of the London-based British Foreign Policy Group think tank.,center
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is not expected to visit Washington until the coronavirus situation allows, with expectations that Biden’s team will make a point of permitting only absolutely essential diplomatic exchanges while virus cases remain high.,center
For the EU, Joe Biden’s first overseas trip as U.S. president was like having big brother come home from university — just in time to confront the neighborhood bully.,center
After four days at busy leaders’ summits of the G7 and NATO, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel finally got a chance to sit down with Biden on Tuesday for their own quiet conversation about EU-U.S. relations, before sending him off to Geneva where he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin.,center
The meeting on Tuesday was nothing short of a lovefest, with perhaps the only disagreement being who was happiest, Biden or the Europeans, that Donald Trump is no longer president of the United States.,center
“Well, Mr. President, dear Joe, we are so pleased to welcome you in Brussels,” von der Leyen said, as she joined Michel to greet Biden on the red carpet of the Council’s Europa building.,center
Biden quickly picked up the theme.,center
As a down payment on rejuvenated relations, Biden agreed to a truce in the nastiest, longest-running cross-Atlantic trade feud — the battle over state subsidies to the airplane manufacturers Airbus and Boeing.,center
The EU side did acknowledge that it was time for Biden and the U.S. to get more serious about carbon pricing, as part of the global response to climate change.,center
That Biden did not even bother to stick around for the closing news conference was also quickly forgiven.,center
On trade, she said it was good Biden had dropped Trump’s pretense for tariffs.,center
But she was even happier about Biden’s views on the transatlantic relationship.,center
“It was impressive to see and to listen to President Biden how clearly he, first of all, was acknowledging that yes, we know that the last four years were difficult and the world has changed, but Europe has also changed,” von der Leyen said.,center
A first test of how well they will do on the stability and security front will be Biden’s high-stakes meeting in Geneva, where the Europeans are counting on him to try to at least set the stage for a breakthrough with Putin.,center
But the Europeans must also consider how dismal ties are between Moscow and Washington and how big a hole Biden and Putin need to climb out of after years of ill-will.,center
Samuel Charap, senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, said that the Biden-Putin confrontation might be regarded as successful if they could agree on such minor steps as restoring normal diplomatic relations, with ambassadors back in each other’s capitals.,center
Von der Leyen said Europe hoped to join forces with Biden so there is “clear pushback on breaches of international law; clear pushback on breaches of human rights” and “secondly, to constrain Russia’s attempts to undermine us.”,center
“But,” she said, “the EU-Russia relationship is on a negative spiral and this is what we conveyed clearly to President Biden.”,center
LONDON — Joe Biden’s arrival in the White House will push the U.K. to work more closely with the EU — but won’t be the thing that clinches a Brexit deal.,center
Biden becomes U.S. president-elect at a critical moment in Brexit talks, as negotiators enter the final weeks where agreement is possible if the U.K. is going to leave the transition period at the end of the year with a trade deal in place.,center
Biden has long opposed Brexit and his Irish roots have sparked hopes in Ireland that he would take the Republic’s side in any cross-border Brexit dispute.,center
"The bottom line is that Brexit is an act of self-isolation," Charles Kupchan, a former President Barack Obama official and now Biden adviser, told Times Radio on Sunday.,center
"Now that Joe Biden is going to be the next president of the United States, that will be a cause for, certainly, a pause for thought in No. 10, to ensure that Irish issues are prioritized as we try to close out this phase of the Brexit negotiation," Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told RTÉ radio Monday.,center
"The statements that have come — not only from Joe Biden but from many on Capitol Hill — that if the Good Friday Agreement and peace on the island of Ireland isn’t protected through Brexit, that securing a trade deal between the U.S. and U.K. would be very, very problematic.",center
However, Sophia Gaston, director of the British Foreign Policy Group, said the impact of Biden’s victory on the Brexit negotiations will be “minimal.”,center
Even if there is a no-deal Brexit and the British government takes steps that breach the Good Friday Agreement, Ruparel argues, its breaching would be such a massive issue for British politics that what Biden does in retaliation or whether he holds a U.K.-U.S. trade deal to ransom “would be entirely irrelevant.”,center
But many analysts and former diplomats expect a Biden presidency will strengthen links with Germany and France.,center
“We know that one of Biden’s core priorities will be to repair, to restore and to reinvigorate transatlantic relations, and by that he means Washington’s relationships with Brussels,” she said.,center
In some ways a Biden victory de-emphasizes the singular importance of the special relationship somewhat because the Biden team will be looking at transatlantic relations in the round.”,center
“When Biden looks towards Europe, he will see Paris and Berlin more as the center of gravity of what’s really important for America in Europe,” he said.,center
Nigel Farage, founder of the Brexit Party and a vocal supporter of Trump, agreed the U.K.’s influence in Washington would diminish under Biden.,center
“Donald Trump is pro-British in a way that Joe Biden never was and will never be,” he said.,center
“A Biden victory means a return to the days of Barack Obama, when he flew to Berlin when he crossed the Atlantic rather than to London.”,center
A Biden victory could delay a U.K.-U.S. trade deal.,center
However, longtime Biden friend Democratic Senator Chris Coons has been vocal in British media since the result was announced.,center
An adviser to the Biden campaign told the Telegraph the new president would not prioritize U.S.-U.K. trade talks in his first hundred days.,center
They warn against expecting white smoke until early or mid-2021, with some warning it could be delayed by even two years under Biden.,center
“A Biden win means this will be a slower process.,center
BELFAST — President Joe Biden arrives in Northern Ireland on Tuesday to salute the 25th anniversary of its U.S.-brokered peace accord.,center
NEW YORK — The EU’s top leaders on Monday bluntly accused U.S. President Joe Biden of disloyalty to the transatlantic alliance, and demanded he explain why he misled France and other European partners in forging a new strategic tie-up with the U.K. and Australia in the Indo-Pacific.,center
“With the new Joe Biden administration, America is back,” European Council President Charles Michel told reporters in New York, as world leaders convened for the high-level debate of the U.N. General Assembly.,center
By failing to consult EU nations about the new Indo-Pacific strategy, under which Australia canceled a blockbuster contract to buy French submarines, Michel said Biden had discarded an agreement reached by leaders after many hours of talks at the G7 summit in Britain in June to remain united in confronting authoritarian regimes, particularly China.,center
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen voiced her own dismay during an interview with CNN, in which she called the treatment of France  “unacceptable” and demanded Biden provide an explanation.,center
Biden, on the other hand, talked a big game about renewing transatlantic ties, according to Michel, but then railroaded European allies with his decision about following through on Trump’s plan to withdraw from Afghanistan, “and,” he added, “a few days ago with this strange announcement.”,center
Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden agreed Tuesday to extend the New START nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which is due to expire next month, according to Kremlin and White House summaries of a phone call between the leaders.,center
According to the Kremlin, Putin used his first call with Biden to urged improved ties.,center
The White House said Biden also confronted Putin on the issues of election interference and of the jailing of the Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order Friday that would limit the ability of American national security agencies to access people’s personal information as part of a transatlantic data-sharing agreement with the European Union.,center
Biden’s executive order will require U.S. intelligence agencies only collect data for specific, defined national security purposes, and in a necessary and proportionate manner.,center
Senior Biden administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said they were confident the White House executive order and the Department of Justice’s new regulations would satisfy the Commission’s concerns.,center
Joe Biden is at the top of the internal short list Hillary Clinton’s transition team is preparing for her pick to be secretary of state, a source familiar with the planning tells POLITICO.,center
Neither Clinton nor her aides have yet told Biden.,center
Biden’s already been deployed to mitigate that damage by Obama.,center
Just on Monday, on a stop at a Clinton campaign office in Toledo, Biden said that he’d spoken to the Latvian president, who’d urged him to come to Europe and reassure people that if Russia invades, NATO will defend them.,center
At that same stop, Biden said he’d hoped to continue some level of involvement in domestic and foreign policy, but added, “I may write a book.,center
Clinton and Biden have a long history together, going back to her days as first lady.,center
Biden bristled at being portrayed as a holdout in greenlighting the raid that killed Osama bin Laden while Clinton was a seen as a strong advocate, and the day before he pulled the plug on running, publicly corrected the record to say he’d privately advised Obama to go ahead with it.,center
In Biden, Clinton would be tapping a seasoned hand on foreign policy, a glad-handing pol with a long memory and a well of deep relationships around the globe.,center
During the Obama administration’s lengthy review of Afghanistan policy early in his tenure, for instance, a skeptical Biden urged the president not to escalate the war, while Clinton backed Gen.,center
Clinton’s campaign was anxious about Biden running — and was watching carefully enough to be gaming out whether he’d announce in an appearance on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert last September, as shown in emails revealed by the WikiLeaks hack.,center
But none of those picks would come with the star power that’s been a feature for all recent picks for the job, and which Biden would bring in buckets.,center
In truth, Sunak is more cricket fan than baseball guy — unlike his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, a regular at Philadelphia Phillies matches back when he was vice president.,center
Sunak is 43 years old; Biden over 80.,center
Sunak attended one of England’s most expensive public schools and is married to a billionaire heiress; Biden plays up his blue collar credentials — not to mention his Irish heritage — whenever he gets the chance.,center
But across gaping divides of age, class and political tradition, Sunak has worked hard to maximize his relationship with Biden in the seven short months he’s been in office.,center
Those efforts appeared to pay off at the culmination of this week’s trip to Washington — Sunak’s first as U.K. prime minister — when Biden spoke in glowing terms about his counterpart’s ability to lead.,center
Sunak was pleased, too, with Biden’s playful nod toward the prospect of a British NATO secretary-general, talking up Ben Wallace’s long-shot candidacy when incumbent Jens Stoltenberg finally retires.,center
And crucially for the British PM’s all-important domestic audience, Biden pronounced the special relationship “in real good shape.”,center
Biden was barely audible as he spoke softly from his chair in the Oval Office.,center
During his 2020 presidential campaign Biden played heavily upon his foreign policy experience, boasting of the number of world leaders he already knew on a personal level.,center
But within the current G7 leadership, Biden is still building relationships with several new-ish heads of state, some representing America’s most critical allies.,center
But according to those around Biden, the pair have meshed well.,center
Biden’s press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, has noted the frequency with which he and Sunak have met — Thursday’s meeting being their fifth since Sunak came to power last October, and their fourth in the past four months.,center
Privately, Biden’s aides say he has appreciated Sunak’s eagerness to lean into the relationship, and his desire to restrict engagements to solely the two leaders where possible, in an effort to get to know the president better.,center
That’s gone down well with Biden, aides say, noting the president prefers to keep meetings informal and allow for personal conversation to flow.,center
If anything, Sunak’s deference to Biden’s experience on the international stage has endeared him to the octogenarian president, multiple U.S. officials say.,center
With Sunak, as with other international counterparts in their mid-40s such as Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen — both of whom also met with Biden in recent weeks — the president sees an opportunity to impart the perspective of a leader who has lived through decades of geopolitical convulsions.,center
“Biden wants someone to carry on the mantle defending their shared values, and Rishi of course respects Biden’s foreign policy experience.” Sunak has told colleagues he is particularly impressed by Biden’s extensive track record of dealing with China.,center
It helps that Sunak is on a stronger footing domestically than his ill-fated predecessor, Liz Truss, meaning Biden feels time invested in the relationship is not going to waste.,center
Biden did not appreciate Johnson’s wisecracks about G7 leaders taking off their shirts at the summit in Germany last year, according to two people close to the president.,center
Biden, too, loves sugary snacks, with chocolate chip ice cream a personal favorite.,center
But while Harris is more attuned to her party’s progressive wing than Biden and keen to placate it, her position is, if anything, more reflective of a changing America— especially in terms of demographics.,center
For all the tensions and disagreements between Netanyahu and Washington over Israel’s Gaza campaign — including its civilian death toll and the risk of sparking a full-blown regional war — Biden has lived up to his claim of being a self-described Zionist president, once again emphasizing his lifelong bond with Israel as recently as July.,center
Of course, Biden did threaten to withhold some arms supplies from Israel in a failed attempt to cajole Netanyahu to agree to a cease-fire or ratchet down the campaign in Gaza.,center
But others aren’t quite so upbeat, and they worry that Biden may well be among the last U.S. presidents who self-identify as Zionist.,center
But Mark Gitenstein, Joe Biden’s choice to be U.S. envoy to the EU, is a beneficiary of the president’s “personal privilege.”,center
Gitenstein, 74, is a close friend of the president and longtime aide, who was literally at Biden’s shoulder for much of 1987 — arguably the most pivotal year in Biden’s lifelong career in public service.,center
At the time, Gitenstein was chief counsel to the Judiciary Committee, and he can be seen in a video of Bork’s high-drama confirmation hearings, perched behind Biden’s right shoulder, as strategically placed — and nearly as close-at-hand — as the senator’s gold-plated wooden gavel propped on the table in front of him.,center
Gitenstein was succeeded in the chief counsel job in 1989 by Ron Klain, now the White House chief of staff, and the ranks of future Biden Senate staffers would eventually include the likes of Antony Blinken, now secretary of state.,center
But it was 1987 and the defeat of the Bork nomination that defined Biden’s future and, as a result, means the EU will soon get an ambassador who has not only the president’s ear but also a piece of his heart.,center
Biden described their friendship during a visit to Bucharest, as Barack Obama’s vice president, in 2009 when Gitenstein was U.S. ambassador to Romania.,center
“There’s an expression when you stand up on the floor of the Senate, if you are going to talk about something personally, Mr. President, we say please excuse the point of personal privilege,” Biden said.,center
At a time when Biden has put a huge premium on restoring transatlantic relations, it's fitting that he would send Brussels an ambassador he considers a relation of his own.,center
Having helped to lead Biden’s vice presidential transition team, Gitenstein was in line for a senior Justice Department position, as head of the Office of Legal Policy, only to be thwarted by criticism from some advocacy groups about his decades as a private lawyer and lobbyist representing big corporate interests.,center
Eisen, who worked on Obama’s presidential campaign and as a special counsel in the White House before being nominated as an ambassador, said that Gitenstein would benefit in the Brussels post both from his prior experience as a diplomat and his long relationship with Biden.,center
His long tenure with President Biden and his closeness to the president matters to how he is perceived by the Europeans, but they also matter to getting the job done.”,center
He was replaced as acting ambassador by Ronald Gidwitz, who was Trump’s ambassador to Belgium and resigned upon Biden’s inauguration in January.,center
Gitenstein is still awaiting Senate confirmation and while his history as a staffer on Capitol Hill will no doubt accrue to his benefit, he also risks getting ensnared in some broader complaints or criticisms that Republican lawmakers have with Biden’s policies toward Europe, especially the president’s decision not to levy sanctions on German firms over Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and instead reach an accommodation with Germany.,center
Bush, said Gitenstein would likely face some scrutiny by Republicans as a result of Biden’s relatively slow approach to dealing with some issues, like trade, on which the U.S. and the EU have substantive disagreements.,center
“I think the Europeans have been a little surprised at the Biden administration's lack of trade policy,” said Conley who is now senior vice president for Europe, Eurasia and the Arctic, as well as director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.,center
While there is a marked difference in tone compared to Trump’s belligerence, Conley noted that on substance so far, the Biden team had changed little.,center
For Gitenstein, the EU ambassador post is a belated benefit from the fight that defined his career and Biden’s in 1987.,center
And it would take Biden another 33 years to realize his dream of being elected president.,center
After last year's election victory, Gitenstein once again jumped into action, joining Biden’s closest confidante Ted Kaufman in leading the presidential transition.,center
Gitenstein’s own 1992 book about the Bork nomination describes how Biden as a senator felt he was fighting for a way of interpreting the U.S. Constitution that would serve all U.S. citizens in the modern era, rather than the strict narrow approach favored by Reagan’s arch-conservative nominee.,center
“I would like to thank my friend Senator Joseph Biden,” he wrote, “who had the confidence in me to make me Chief Counsel of the Senate Judiciary Committee so that I could participate in the events described in this book.”,center
“Mark comes out of the Biden school of bipartisanship.,center
You know it's deeply rooted in the president's career and Mark has been a part of that extended Biden family, a close part of it for decades.”,center
Joe Biden officially announced his bid for president Thursday, marking the third White House campaign of his lengthy political career but the first in which he enters as a front-runner.,center
For months, Biden anguished about whether to mount another White House run.,center
Biden ran headlong into the dynamic before he even announced when a former Nevada Democratic assemblywoman, Lucy Flores, accused him of inappropriately touching her in an overly friendly manner.,center
Three other Democratic women also came forward, plunging Biden’s not-yet-a-campaign into crisis mode and highlighting a generational divide in which Biden was criticized as being out of touch with the changing times.,center
But Biden’s belief that he’s uniquely situated to defeat President Donald Trump, as well as the encouragement from party elders and rank-and-file voters, made it impossible for him to sit out the election, even after more than 20 candidates jumped in and new progressive groups vowed to launch a Never Biden campaign.,center
“The primary isn’t anchored but now it becomes more centered around Biden,” said Joe Trippi, a veteran adviser of Democratic presidential campaigns.,center
“Today, the rest of the field will position itself against Biden.,center
Beto O’Rourke could position himself against Biden as old vs.,center
The race, however, won’t be a clear referendum on Biden because the unstable politics of the times and the growing number — and dynamic quality — of other candidates makes it difficult to get a clear picture of the field, Trippi and others say.,center
One of Biden’s paths to defending his lead is to make the case that his age — he’ll be 78 in 2020 — is not a liability, but an asset that brings deep experience on the national and world stage at a time when Democrats are hungry for a win.,center
And as top Democratic contenders drift leftward, Biden’s team hopes his record it will give him an advantage with moderate voters, who might be more of a silent plurality than social media — fueled by the loud voices progressive activists — suggests.,center
This time, who can win and who can beat Donald Trump is Democrats’ No. 1 criteria,” said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who worked on Biden’s 2008 campaign.,center

But Lake says while the media might comb through Biden’s record, fellow Democratic contenders are unlikely to aim their fire at him, instead focusing resources on their own name ID and searching for a breakout moment.,center
Biden’s entry into the race caps months of private deliberation over whether to run, shifting announcement dates that kept getting pushed off as his future opponents hired staff and leaks that claimed he was planning to pick an early running mate — Stacey Abrams, the failed Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia — to help him win.,center
But the accounts only fed speculation that Biden felt a desperate need to shore up support in the changing party.,center
Biden has a slight lead or is neck-and-neck with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in most national and early state polls.,center
However, Biden’s support is strong among older, white voters who typically make up more than half of the electorate that most often votes in Democratic primaries.,center
And while Sanders was within just 2 percentage points of Biden in a recent Iowa poll, 70 percent of those queried said they see Biden’s views on the issues “about right” while 48 percent said Sanders’ views are “too liberal.”,center
Biden lost his two prior races for president in 1988, after a plagiarism scandal, and in 2008 when Barack Obama captured the Democratic Party’s heart and pulled an upset win in early state Iowa, putting to rest any doubts that he was electable.,center
The theory of Biden’s case this time: He connects with middle-class voters, is respected worldwide by foreign leaders, has deep government experience and would bring a sense of normalcy and stability that voters crave in the Trump era.,center

“Biden’s argument is that he would offer a ballast in the storm, a seasoned leader of palpable character who would provide a clear contrast with Trump,” said David Axelrod, a former top adviser for Obama.,center
“The political case is that Biden is particularly strong in the industrial Midwest, and states Trump won in 2016 and must win again to be reelected.”,center
Biden’s Rust Belt appeal was part of the reason that Obama chose him as his running mate in 2008.,center
Back then, Biden served as an ambassador to white swing and working-class voters, and the veteran senator added a touch of gravitas to the ticket for the exciting but relatively inexperienced hope-and-change candidate.,center
However, as the former right-hand man and running mate of the popular former president, Biden has a natural constituency of supporters in the party, including African-Americans for whom the first black president is history made flesh.,center
Biden trounced the field in a recent poll, with 43 percent of African-Americans polled saying they supported the former vice president.,center
Biden’s support among black voters, however, is likely to be tested in the new progressive era as his past opposition to forced busing in 1972 and his authorship of the 1994 crime bill that helped lead to a wave of mass incarceration of African-Americans are revisited.,center

Another potential problem for Biden as he tries to court black voters as well as women: his role as the Senate judiciary committee chairman handling the 1991 hearings into Anita Hill’s sexual harassment allegations against Clarence Thomas during his successful Supreme Court confirmation hearings.,center
In the run-up to his presidential announcement, Biden began to express more public regret about his support of the crime bill and his handling of Hill’s hearings.,center
Speaking at the National Action Network’s Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast in Washington in January, Biden acknowledged that “I haven’t always been right.,center
Biden didn’t mention, however, that he actually authored the crime bill, which set different penalties for crack vs.,center
“It was a big mistake when it was made,” Biden said, using the passive voice and blaming unnamed “experts” who told politicians like him that crack was worse and somehow fundamentally different.,center
Two months later, Biden spoke out about the Hill hearings he chaired in the Senate and lamented that “she paid a terrible price.,center
One of the progressive groups arrayed against Biden, the Working Families Party, said Biden “utterly failed Anita Hill when she bravely came forward to testify against” Thomas and also pointed to the crime bill.,center
The group’s national director, Maurice Mitchell, said the countless votes Biden cast in his 36 years in the Senate are all fair game.,center
“Any 2020 candidate is going to have to explain their record, and Biden’s is longer and spottier than most.,center
A new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows just 44 percent of voters approve of Biden’s job performance, and 46 percent say he’s “mentally fit.”,center
WASHINGTON — Former Vice President Joe Biden would lead President Donald Trump in a 2020 general election, according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll.,center
Only 35 percent of voters would choose to reelect Trump in 2020, the poll shows — substantially fewer than the 46 percent who would vote instead for Biden, who said Monday that he is “not closing the door” on a third attempt at the presidency in 2020.,center
Biden’s 11-point margin is actually smaller than the poll’s previous question, in which voters are asked whether they will vote to reelect Trump, or for a generic Democrat.,center
“Former Vice President Joe Biden has the upper hand in a hypothetical matchup against President Donald Trump, but he underperforms compared with a generic Democrat,” said Kyle Dropp, Morning Consult’s co-founder and chief research officer.,center
“Notably, 86 percent of Democrats say they would vote for a generic Democrat over Trump, but only 78 percent of Democrats say they prefer Biden over Trump.”,center
Independent voters tilt away from the incumbent: 41 percent would vote for Biden, and 26 percent for Trump.,center
POLITICO reported last week that Biden has, in recent months, “shifted unmistakably in favor of running” for president in 2020.,center
Joe Biden cited his son’s death less than five months later in deciding not to mount a 2016 presidential bid.,center
In one of a series of TV interviews with NBC News personalities on Monday, Biden was asked by Megyn Kelly about challenging Trump’s electoral base.,center
“They love me more,” Biden shot back.,center
The POLITICO/Morning Consult poll found Biden has a 9-point lead in the Midwest, 45 percent to 36 percent — roughly equal to his national advantage.,center
The two candidates run neck-and-neck among white voters, with Biden at 41 percent and Trump at 40 percent.,center
And Biden is only slightly behind Trump among white voters without a college degree, 37 percent to 41 percent.,center
WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer brushed off Russian President Vladimir Putin's threats Friday as they met to discuss Ukraine's pleas to use British-supplied missiles against targets on Russian soil.,center
In response to a shouted question asking how soon he was prepared to let Ukraine fire missiles deeper into Russia, Biden added: "We're going to discuss that now.",center
The U.K.’s Conservative former Defense Secretary Grant Shapps said the meeting between Biden and Starmer “must deliver one outcome: Ukraine must be able to strike with Storm Shadows inside Russia if Russia continues to launch attacks on Ukraine from these locations.”,center
The use of Storm Shadow missiles relies partly on U.S. technology, so officials see Biden’s approval as vital to the process.,center
His meeting with Biden was followed by a 90-minute wider summit with Foreign Secretary David Lammy and aides, including National Security Adviser Tim Barrow, U.K. Ambassador Karen Pierce, his chief of staff Sue Gray and Director of Communications Matthew Doyle.,center
Starmer had been actively seeking the wider strategic meeting with Biden for some time, after seeing the president at July’s NATO summit in his first week in office.,center
The European Council on Thursday will get a 28th leader back around the table, if only briefly, when U.S. President Joe Biden logs in to participate in a virtual leaders’ summit.,center
Biden, whose defeat of Donald Trump left many Europeans rejoicing at the prospect of renewed transatlantic relations, will join the videoconference of EU heads of state and government at the invitation of Council President Charles Michel.,center
Michel announced Biden’s planned participation on Tuesday as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Brussels for his first in-person visit as Biden’s top envoy.,center
It was not immediately clear how long Biden would speak or remain on the videoconference listening to his 27 counterparts, not to mention Michel and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who also sit around the summit table.,center
Biden is expected to join the leaders’ videoconference at 8:45 p.m. The summit was originally scheduled to be held in person but was shifted to virtual format because of a coronavirus surge in several EU countries.,center
Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski took what appeared to be a shot at U.S. President Joe Biden by drawing a parallel between his widely panned debate performance against Donald Trump and the decline of the Roman empire.,center
Sikorski posted Friday morning on X: “It’s important to manage one’s ride into the sunset,” just hours after Biden’s stumbling debate display led to growing calls for him to pull out of the race for a second White House term.,center
Biden’s debate performance in the early hours of Friday was at times unintelligible with a raspy voice, wandering eyes, pallid complexion and a halting delivery, sparking horror among Democratic operatives and the European media.,center
I was afraid … in the sense: it was to be expected that in a direct confrontation, in a debate, it would not be easy for President Biden.”,center
That’s something that U.S. President Joe Biden should keep in mind as he prepares to meet with the Russian president on Wednesday.,center
U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said he would do “whatever it takes” to combat the spread of coronavirus within the country — including locking down the U.S. if deemed necessary.,center
“I would shut it down; I would listen to the scientists,” Biden told ABC’s David Muir in a joint interview with his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, to air Sunday.,center
Biden’s comments represent the strongest potential action the Democratic presidential nominee has proposed to stanch the spread of the virus that has killed at least 175,000 people across the U.S. as of Friday evening.,center
Biden, appearing in his first interview since officially becoming the Democrat’s nominee for president this week, strongly disagreed with Trump’s reasoning.,center
“And incompetence,” Biden added.,center
But in the key area of defense, there are some gaps — and that's leading global military chiefs to pore over the statements of the president's allies and appointees to attempt to glean some clues, specifically over the $369 billion trilateral submarine program known as AUKUS he will inherit from Joe Biden.,center
This uncertainty has left ministers and government officials in London and Canberra scrambling to discover how the Republican is likely to view the Biden-era deal when he returns to the White House in January.,center
But the brightest glimmer of hope may be an Economist essay Waltz co-authored last month that slams Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for a rash of global crises, but reserves a some praise for AUKUS.,center
“Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris have taken some positive steps on China, such as strengthening export controls and establishing AUKUS, a trilateral security partnership with Britain and Australia, but these have been more than outweighed by the distraction caused by failed policies in Europe and the Middle East,” Waltz wrote with Matthew Kroenig, a former Pentagon strategist.,center
“One of the successes of Trump’s term, and the Biden-Harris administration, was a significant amount of mutual understanding of partners in London and Europe writ large about the danger China poses globally,” he said.,center
Meanwhile, there seemed to be a step forward when the Biden administration introduced legislation to ease the trade of sensitive technology between the three nations earlier this summer.,center
GENEVA — U.S. President Joe Biden’s support for a patent waiver for coronavirus vaccines is a positive step forward, and a welcome return to multilateralism for the United States.,center
The Biden administration says that the “negotiations will take time.” How much?,center
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden—who as in previous outings interspersed some strong moments with several mushy or head-scratching ones—seemed emphatically life-sized, once again, in the latest Democratic Party debate in Houston.,center
Biden’s previous uneven performances didn’t dislodge him atop the race, and so caution is justified in predicting bleeding wounds from this one.,center
The durability of the Biden paradox—not so strong to be running away with the race, but strong enough to keep people who could claim his space among moderate, establishment-oriented Democrats from breaking through—was causing some irritation among rival campaigns after the debate.,center
Biden, by these lights, benefits from clearing a bar that should be higher for a front-runner.,center
“He didn’t fall over,” an adviser to one of his rivals scoffed, calling Biden “the anti-expectation candidate.”,center
“I think that we are at a tough point right now, because there’s a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden’s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling,” Cory Booker opined on CNN after the debate.,center
Kamala Harris did not school Biden like she did in their first debate encounter, but she did find high notes in continually turning her fire on Trump, who in one caustic line she likened to the man behind the curtain in The Wizard of Oz, who turned out to be “a really small dude.” Julian Castro did try to school Biden, though he risked coming off as rude by not-so-subtly (and inaccurately in context) implying that Biden was suffering from senescence: “Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?”,center

It was in the closing moments when Biden succeeded in ways that often fail him in connecting life experience to a larger rationale for his campaign.,center
Several candidates gave heartfelt answers but it was here in the closing moments when Biden succeeded in ways that often fail him in connecting life experience to a larger rationale for his campaign.,center
Speaking of the deaths he has suffered in his family—his first wife and young daughter in 1972, and his adult son Beau in 2015—Biden said “The way I’ve dealt with it is finding purpose.,center
PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Joe Biden will have a phone call in the coming days to discuss the escalating diplomatic crisis stemming from Australia’s cancellation of a billion-euro submarine deal with France.,center
French government spokesman Gabriel Attal announced on TV station BFMTV that the discussion would take place “in the next few days” at Biden’s request.,center

U.S. President Joe Biden got confused at a recent campaign event, mixing up former German Chancellors Angela Merkel and Helmut Kohl, the latter of whom died in 2017.,center
It was Biden’s second such mix-up in less than a week.,center
6 riots at the U.S. Capitol, which had happened a few months prior, when the German leader addressed Biden.,center
“And then Helmut Kohl turned to me and said, ‘What would you say, Mr. President, if you picked up the London Times and learned that 1,000 people had broken down the doors of the British parliament, killed some bobbies on the way in, to deny the prime minister to take office,”’ Biden said, as reported by multiple outlets.,center
While telling another story about the G7 summit, Biden earlier this week confused French President Emmanuel Macron with the late François Mitterrand, who led France from 1981 to 1995 and died in 1996.,center
Former President Donald Trump, set to be Biden’s main opponent at the upcoming U.S. presidential election, is not immune to gaffes himself.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden laid into beleaguered U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss’ tax-cutting agenda Saturday, calling it a “mistake” and warning that a lack of “sound policy in other countries” could hold back the United States.,center
Speaking on a campaign stop in Oregon, Biden claimed it was “predictable” that Truss would have to row back on her agenda, which was also openly criticized by the International Monetary Fund.,center
With inflation expected to play a major part in the upcoming U.S. mid-term elections, Biden said the American economy remained “strong as hell,” but that he is “concerned about the rest of the world.”,center
Biden’s swipe at the Truss agenda is an unusual move, given that presidents tend to avoid commenting on the domestic policy of allies.,center
While not mentioning China by name, Biden’s message is clearly aimed at Beijing.,center
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — U.S. President Joe Biden offered a full-throated American commitment to the nations of Southeast Asia on Saturday, pledging at a Cambodia summit to help stand against China’s growing dominance in the region — without mentioning the other superpower by name.,center
But Xi hovered over the proceedings just two days before he and Biden are set to have their highly anticipated first face-to-face meeting at the G20 summit in Indonesia.,center
The Biden White House has declared Xi’s nation its greatest economic and military rival of the next century and while the president never called out China directly, his message was squarely aimed at Beijing.,center
“Together we will tackle the biggest issues of our time, from climate to health security to defend against significant threats to rules-based order and to threats against the rule of law,” Biden said.,center
The U.S. has long derided China’s violation of the international rules-based order — from trade to shipping to intellectual property — and Biden tried to emphasize his administration’s solidarity with a region American has too often overlooked.,center
Much of Biden’s agenda at ASEAN was to demonstrate resistance to Beijing.,center
Biden also pledged to help the area’s infrastructure initiative — meant as a counter to China’s Belt and Road program — as well as to lead a regional response to the ongoing violence in Myanmar.,center
But it is the Xi meeting that will be the main event for Biden’s week abroad, which comes right after his party showed surprising strength in the U.S. midterm elections, emboldening the president as he headed overseas.,center
Biden will circumnavigate the globe, having made his first stop at a major climate conference in Egypt before arriving in Cambodia for a pair of weekend summits before going on to Indonesia.,center
Declaring China the United States’ biggest rival, Biden again tried to focus on Beijing but has had to devote an extraordinary amount of resources to helping Ukraine fend off Russia’s invasion.,center
Biden declared that the ten nations that make up ASEAN are “the heart of my administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy” and that his time in office — which included hosting the leaders in Washington earlier this year — begins “a new era in our cooperation.” He did, though, mistakenly identify the host country as “Colombia” while offering thanks at the beginning of his speech.,center
“We will build a better future, a better future we all say we want to see,” Biden said.,center
Biden was only the second U.S. president to set foot in Cambodia, after Obama visited in 2012.,center
White House aides said that Biden had no scheduled plans to visit.,center
As is customary, Biden met with the host country’s leader at the start of the summit.,center
Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, said Biden would "engage across the board in service of America's interests and to advance America's strategic position and our values.” He said Biden was meeting with Hun Sen because he was the leader of the host country.,center
U.S. officials said Biden urged the Cambodian leader to make a greater commitment to democracy and “reopen civic and political space” ahead of the country’s next elections.,center
Both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris urged Israel to wrap up its military operations in Gaza, arguing that a key obstacle to a cease-fire and hostage release deal has now been eliminated.,center
Every administration has to readjust to respond to world events, but the Israel-Hamas conflict has been particularly disruptive to Biden’s other foreign policy efforts.,center
Joe Biden momentarily seems confused about who he’s meeting as Rishi Sunak drops in at the White House.,center
WASHINGTON, D.C. — First he renamed the British prime minister “Rashee Sanook.” Now Joe Biden has bestowed Rishi Sunak with a whole new job title which doesn’t actually exist in the U.K.,center
Welcoming the British premier to the White House for the first time Thursday, Biden immediately mixed up his honorifics, wrongly addressing Sunak as “Mr president.” The British PM smiled politely as Biden was swiftly forced to correct himself.,center
“Mr president?” Biden went on.,center
Despite Biden’s misstep, the two men seemed relaxed in one another’s company as they met on Sunak’s second full day in the American capital.,center
Biden gave reporters a thumbs-up as he declared the so-called “special relationship” between Britain and the U.S. in “real good shape.”,center
“Together, we are providing economic and humanitarian aid and security systems to Ukraine in their fight against a brutal invasion from Russia,” Biden said.,center
After Biden mentioned former PM Winston Churchill’s legendary wartime stay at the White House, when First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt is said to have blocked the then-prime minister from entering husband Franklin’s bedroom at 3 a.m., Sunak joked: “Sir, don’t worry — you won’t see me there, bothering you and the first lady.”,center
Europe on Monday proposed teaming up with incoming U.S. President Joe Biden to squeeze China out of the global technology trade.,center
Exhausted by four years of trade tensions on two fronts, fighting against both U.S. President Donald Trump on one flank and Beijing on the other, Europe is trying to seize an early initiative ahead of Biden’s inauguration on January 20 by rolling out geostrategic plans for closer transatlantic cooperation.,center
Both Weyand and the other senior official argued a resumption of TTIP negotiations was not back on the cards, both because of fierce public opposition to the deal and because negotiations had become stuck over things like EU protections for agriculture and U.S. public procurement discrimination with the Buy America Act, which Biden has said he wants to ramp up rather than dismantle.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden wrote to the leaders of Egypt and Qatar on Friday to urge them to press Hamas to work out a deal with Israel for the release of hostages as part of a broader cease-fire agreement.,center
Biden wrote letters to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and the Qatar’s Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani urging them “to secure commitments from Hamas to agree and abide by a deal,” a senior U.S. administration official said, according to AP, AFP and Reuters.,center
The official also said Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, will meet Monday with some of the families of the estimated 100 hostages still believed to be held in Gaza out of the 253 people kidnapped by Hamas on Oct.,center
On Thursday, Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time since the Israeli airstrike occurred, sparking outrage from Israel’s allies.,center
In the 30-minute conversation, Biden urged Netanyahu to expand humanitarian access in Gaza and to give his negotiators in Cairo a mandate to reach a deal that would allow for a  six-week cease-fire in exchange for the release of hostages.,center
Wearing a smile, Russian leader restates preference for Biden over Trump.,center
Vladimir Putin appears unfazed by U.S. President Joe Biden’s calling him a “crazy SOB,” accepting the insult as an “adequate” reaction — not once, but twice in a two-minute conversation with a state TV reporter.,center
The Russian president suggested Biden’s insult stemmed from Putin’s having stated a preference for Biden over Donald Trump as America’s leader.,center
During a Wednesday night fundraiser in San Francisco, Biden said: “We have a crazy SOB like that guy Putin, and others, and we always have to worry about nuclear conflict, but the existential threat to humanity is climate.”,center
Speaking about what is best for Russia, Putin added, smiling: “I’ve said it once and can repeat: Biden.”,center
During a recent interview with U.S. conservative political commentator Tucker Carlson, Putin said he couldn’t remember the last time he spoke with Biden, guessing it was before Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.,center
Putin noted he had a “personal relationship” with Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, but in another interview stated that Biden was an old-school politician, and was therefore preferable to Russia.,center
Biden has not held back in criticizing Putin, even calling him a killer in 2021.,center
U.S. President Joe Biden and his aides must feel they’ve fallen down a rabbit hole where, much like in Alice in Wonderland, their Israeli interlocutors neither mean what they say nor say what they mean.,center
Desperate to seal a lasting Gaza cease-fire — partly to gain some electoral ease at home, where polling suggests Biden has a big Israel problem — the White House has been pressing hard to secure a permanent truce.,center
Biden appeared to have every reason for his confidence — after all, the three-part proposal was largely developed by Israel in the first place.,center
Netanyahu scorned the deal within hours of Biden’s announcement, interrupting the Sabbath to say any permanent cease-fire was a non-starter.,center
And in response, a frustrated Biden once again accused the Israeli premier of wanting to prolong the conflict for purely domestic political reasons and save his rumbunctious government from imploding.,center
The truth is, the pressure on Biden from his party’s clamorous progressive wing is only growing.,center
As the death tally in Gaza climbs and the humanitarian crisis worsens, Democratic donors’ waning support for the Israeli operation could well cost Biden his reelection.,center
And with every strike that leads to a high civilian death toll, Biden’s electoral dilemma grows.,center
However, if Biden were to come down hard on Israel and stop sending weapons and kit, then he’d enrage pro-Israel voters.,center
As pollster Douglas Schoen said: “This issue is a stone-cold loser for Biden.,center
Meanwhile, Biden’s Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been criss-crossing the region, meeting with Arab leaders, trying to get the deal over the line to pile pressure on Israel.,center
Unsurprisingly, Blinken did get what he wanted from Gantz, who said in a statement that it was “imperative” the deal approved by Biden be implemented.,center
This is because Gallant’s main policy gripe with Netanyahu isn’t over a hostage deal, it’s over the absence of a post-war Israeli governance plan for Gaza — something Biden’s also pleaded with Israel to come up with for months.,center
The Biden administration can at least draw some comfort from the same poll, which suggests a majority of Jewish Israelis see a hostage deal as the higher national priority.,center
With their eyes fixed on the U.S. election, Biden and his aides arguably jumped too quickly to push a deal that wasn’t oven-ready and hadn’t yet been endorsed by all members of the Israeli government.,center
Joe Biden has shaken more than his share on European shores.,center
Serving two terms as vice president under Barack Obama, U.S. President-elect Joe Biden spent eight years shaking hands before and after meetings with European leaders.,center
What follows is a trip down memory lane for Biden and European leaders, and though it’s far from comprehensive, it is anything but brief.,center
It comes as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Mike Johnson dismissed on Wednesday the outgoing Joe Biden administration’s request to include $24 billion in Ukraine-related aid in a spending bill Congress needs to pass by Dec.,center
While the U.S. originally expressed concerns about the financial viability of the loan, the Biden administration eventually pledged to contribute $20 billion in an attempt to corner Trump into continuing American support for Ukraine.,center
BERLIN — Forty-eight hours after Joe Biden emerged as the winner of the U.S. presidential election, Europe was still basking in the afterglow.,center
Not even Angela Merkel could resist a victory lap, delivering a live statement on German television to congratulate Biden and Kamala Harris.,center
For many European leaders, Biden’s win represented more than just the prayed-for end of Trump’s presidency — it was a welcome shot in the arm for Europe’s battered brand of centrist politics as it battles its own populist demons, a glimmer of hope that the “good guys” can win.,center
But the unbridled enthusiasm of the Continent’s dominant political class for Biden reveals another reality: These days, Europe’s only friends in Washington are Democrats.,center
Röttgen, who is running to lead the CDU and with hopes of succeeding Merkel as chancellor next year, made clear his strong preference for Biden and that he thinks Trump is dangerous.,center
The elder Helme resigned Monday over comments he made about the “deep state” being responsible for Biden’s victory.,center
Needless to say, Europe’s enthusiasm for Biden and the Democrats will not be lost on the Republicans.,center
While some Europeans are leery of what could happen in four years if Trump or someone in his mold returns to the White House, chances are those concerns will fade if, as expected, Biden reaffirms the American commitment to Europe.,center
LONDON — Boris Johnson will attempt to emulate his hero by agreeing a new "Atlantic charter" with Joe Biden ahead of the G7 summit, echoing the one signed by Winston Churchill and Franklin D.,center
The 1941 manifesto for a shared post-war vision was devised on board Royal Navy battleship HMS Prince of Wales and U.S. heavy cruiser USS Augusta in secrecy and only made public several days later — a marked contrast to the heavily trailed encounter between Johnson and Biden.,center
The not-so-veiled analogy suggested by the declaration is that coronavirus is Biden and Johnson’s war, and that they recognize their responsibility to shape how their own countries and the wider world emerge from it.,center
Some of the sweeping principles to which Johnson and Biden have pledged themselves — defending democracy, upholding collective security, and promoting fairer and more sustainable trade — will have been familiar to their wartime antecedents.,center
LONDON — President Joe Biden has quietly shelved plans for a “foundational” trade agreement with the U.K. ahead of the 2024 election — following Senate opposition and disagreements over the scope of the deal.,center
But last month IPEF talks fell apart after senior Democrats criticized the Biden administration’s negotiation of trade provisions that did not contain enforceable labor standards.,center
Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch pitched the IPEF-style deal in April during Biden’s visit to Belfast, Bloomberg reported, to reinvigorate talks first started under the Trump administration.,center
When POLITICO first reported on proposed talks in October, Wyden said it was “extremely disappointing” the Biden administration was attempting to proceed “with a 'trade agreement' that will neither benefit the American public, nor respect the role of Congress in international trade.”,center
In the meantime, the focus of the U.K.-U.S. trade relationship is predominantly on securing a critical minerals agreement that would allow British automotive firms to tap into electric vehicle rebates offered in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.,center
Biden has returned again and again to Europe — from his ancestral home Ireland to the farthest reaches of the Balkans.,center
BERLIN — Few American presidents come into office with as much international travel under their belts as Joe Biden.,center
During his tenure as vice president alone, Biden logged more than 1 million miles on trips to 57 countries.,center
Adding the hundreds of trips he made as U.S. senator on the foreign relations committee beginning in the 1970s, one could make a good case that Biden has the largest carbon footprint of anyone who’s ever lived in the White House.,center
Many of those trips were to Europe, which has always had a special place in Biden’s heart.,center
The official purpose of Biden’s trip might be to show European allies some love after the beating they suffered under his predecessor — but Biden also just really likes Europe.,center
“It’s been the joy of my life,” Biden said a few years ago about his travels, expressing boyish awe at “how similar we are.”,center
Here are five places that helped turn Biden into a closet European.,center
A lot of American politicians have Irish heritage, but few seem to really get the place like Biden, both of whose parents were of Irish stock.,center
Kennedy, another Irish Catholic president, Biden grew up in a working-class family that struggled to make ends meet.,center
During a presidential debate with Donald Trump last year, Biden, who accused his opponent of being a racist, said people like him “look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics and like me and people who don’t have money.”,center
Just how personal Biden’s Irish connection is to him became clear during a visit he took with his family to County Mayo in western Ireland in 2016.,center
The other corner of Europe where the professional and political have melded for Biden is the former Yugoslavia, a region rife with historical divisions not dissimilar to those of Ireland.,center
The embargo was never lifted, mainly due to European resistance, but as the Srebrenica genocide and other horrors of the war would later illustrate, Biden and other critics were right.,center
Biden never gave up on the Balkans, returning time and again, long after most western politicians had lost interest.,center
After becoming vice president in 2009, Biden visited the region again, in part because he worried that Washington had all but forgotten about it after 9/11.,center
In 2016, Biden visited Kosovo for the opening of a new highway named after his late son, Beau, a lawyer who had worked to help establish a new justice system in the country in the early 2000s.,center
“Beau loved this country like I do,” Biden said of his son, who died of brain cancer in 2015.,center
As a convinced transatlanticist, Biden is nowhere more at home than in the wheelhouse of the western alliance — NATO headquarters.,center
Unlike his predecessor, who complained about the cost of NATO’s new modern complex and declared the alliance “obsolete,” Biden will celebrate the partnership as one of the greatest achievements of modern history.,center
Biden has been a fixture at NATO ever since he entered public service.,center
When the Senate approved NATO enlargement in 1998, Biden called it “the beginning of another 50 years of peace.”,center
For Biden, NATO is more than just an alliance; it represents the power of American ideals and what many of his generation still regard as the U.S.’s historic mission to spread freedom and democracy across the world.,center
Biden’s connection to the Bavarian capital has less to do with its famous beer halls than with the annual security conference there, which some lovingly call “Davos with guns.”,center
Biden became a regular at the annual meeting during the Cold War when it was still known by its German name: Wehrkunde.,center
During the Cold War, Biden would join other leading lights of the western alliance in the basement Stube of the five-star hotel that hosts the meeting to talk shop over beers and plot against the Soviets.,center
Biden never stopped coming.,center
In a speech at the meeting in 2019, now known as the Munich Security Conference, Biden upstaged then-Vice President Mike Pence, who was also there, exclaiming, “I promise you … We’ll be back.” Biden’s message to Europe: Trump won’t be around much longer.,center
Biden’s decision to spend his honeymoon on Hungary’s famous Lake Balaton wouldn’t be that notable if it weren’t for the year he did so: 1977.,center
That didn’t dissuade Biden, then still in his first term as a senator, from taking his bride behind the Iron Curtain.,center
It was Biden’s first trip to the region, and in addition to taking in the beauty of Balaton, he also spent time in Budapest, meeting with communist officials, journalists and dissidents.,center
The trip, which was organized by Tom Lantos, a Hungarian-born Holocaust survivor who worked as an adviser to Biden before becoming a U.S. congressman, left a strong impression on the future president.,center
Biden won a place in Hungary’s heart that year by promising that the U.S. would return the Hungarian crown, which the country had discovered in Austria in 1945.,center
Those good memories notwithstanding, Biden is unlikely to return to Hungary anytime soon.,center
When United States President Joe Biden decided to travel to Israel this week, his immediate objective was to express solidarity with Israel, to avoid escalating the war beyond Gaza and to ask tough questions about the strategy Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war Cabinet were pursuing.,center
Jordan’s King Abdullah II, who had previously warned the Middle East was “on the brink of falling into the abyss,” canceled a summit with Biden in Amman that was scheduled for Thursday, declaring a three-day period of mourning.,center
Though Biden understandably hesitated about whether to set off to Israel after the sudden turnaround, he decided to go through with the trip, hoping to make the best of a rapidly deteriorating situation.,center
Promising to submit an “unprecedented support package” for Israel to the U.S. Congress by the end of the week, Biden doubled down on his support for the Jewish state while also using the visit to emphasize his determination to prevent the conflict from escalating.,center
Biden also pressed Netanyahu’s government to let humanitarian supplies into Gaza immediately, which it reluctantly agreed to do — provided none of it went to Hamas.,center
Biden wasn’t about to tell Israel what to do.,center
Additionally, achieving rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which was already a Biden priority, is now more urgent than ever.,center
Joe Biden signaled a possible new direction for U.S. policy toward Syria in remarks in Turkey on Saturday, where the vice president was meeting with Turkish leaders to discuss the bloody civil war next door.,center
Biden was speaking at Istanbul’s Dolmabahçe Palace, where he held meetings with Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.,center
But Biden also went beyond past Obama administration statements and suggested the U.S. would be willing to use military means if necessary.,center
The National Security Council declined to say whether Biden’s remarks signaled a shift in U.S. strategy.,center
Biden reassured Turkey, which is dealing with a flare-up in its long-running conflict with Kurdish separatist groups led by the PKK.,center
The PKK, Biden said, “is a terrorist group plain and simple” — one he said has defied the Turkish government efforts to make peace.,center
Until that changes, “you must do what you need to protect your people,” Biden said.,center
Biden, pointedly, did not mention the YPG in his own list of terrorist groups.,center
Biden’s remarks come days ahead of long-anticipated Syria peace talks, which have been in limbo amid a bitter feud between the Middle East’s longtime rivals: Iran and Saudi Arabia.,center
The National Security Council declined to say whether Biden’s remarks signaled a shift in U.S. strategy, and directed questions to the vice president’s office.,center
LOS ANGELES — Joe Biden steamrolled across the South on Tuesday, carried Texas and won a stunning victory in Minnesota, severely weakening Bernie Sanders and recasting the race as a head-to-head contest between them.,center
But momentum was on Biden’s side.,center
Early, quick calls for Biden in the Virginia, North Carolina and Alabama primaries offered the first sign that the former vice president had won over much of an unsettled electorate’s late-breaking vote.,center
Addressing cheering supporters in California before polls here closed, Biden said, “It’s still early, but things are looking awful, awful good.”,center
Instead, Biden surpassed him.,center
Sanders, speaking at his rally in Burlington, Vt., on Tuesday night, predicted the night would end well for him despite Biden’s string of wins.,center
The early results appeared likely to narrow the race to Sanders and Biden, with the rest of the field barely hanging on.,center
Biden won Elizabeth Warren’s home state, Massachusetts, and Mike Bloomberg was teetering elsewhere.,center
After skipping the first four nominating states but spending hundreds of millions on TV ads, Bloomberg received disappointing news in the quick calls for Biden in Virginia and North Carolina.,center
Most likely, the set of elections, in which about one-third of delegates will be awarded, will culminate in a grouping of Democratic voters around opposite poles — progressives to Sanders and moderates to Biden.,center
But because of late balloting, the results from California could take days or weeks to count — and even small margins in that state could be significant to Biden, Bloomberg and Warren.,center
If Tuesday was a measure of Sanders’ durability, it also confirmed the extent of Biden’s momentum.,center
Biden said Monday that his campaign has raised more than $30 million since the beginning of last month, as he attempts to catch up to Sanders.,center
Rejecting criticism from fellow moderates that he could help Sanders by leaching support from Biden, Bloomberg said Tuesday, “I’m not helping Bernie Sanders.,center
DUBLIN — U.S. President Joe Biden often proclaims a sentimental soft spot for Ireland.,center
While Donald Trump rejected the OECD effort, Biden and his treasury chief, Janet Yellen, support it and, as part of any deal, want American multinationals to pay 21 percent on their profits overseas.,center
