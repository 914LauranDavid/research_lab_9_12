            "2: \"[We] cannot have another 30,000 more Palestinians dead,\" Biden said in an interview with MSNBC on Saturday.\n",
            "3: Asked whether an invasion of Rafah, in the south of Gaza on the border with Egypt, was a red line, Biden replied in the affirmative: \"It is a red line.\"\n",
            "4: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is “hurting Israel more than helping Israel” in his approach to the war against Hamas in Gaza, Biden said.\n",
            "5: Netanyahu that “he must pay more attention to the innocent lives being lost as a consequence of the actions taken,” Biden said.\n",
            "6: The Biden administration said that it now wants to built a floating pier to help deliver large amounts of aid into Gaza.\n",
            "7: Even as Biden warned Israel's government against further targeting of the civilian population in Gaza, he reiterated his general support.\n",
            "8: Ever since Joe Biden won the U.S. presidency, the rhetoric from Europe’s leaders has been filled with anticipation of a new transatlantic dawn.\n",
            "9: Biden, a dyed-in-the-wool transatlanticist, pushed all the right buttons, stroking the Continent’s bruised ego after four years of relentless abuse.\n",
            "10: And Europe stands ready,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen declared on the occasion of Biden’s inauguration.\n",
            "11: Given the opportunity in recent weeks to show the Biden administration it was serious about geostrategic collaboration, Europe opted instead to show Washington the finger.\n",
            "12: In late December, for example, the EU, prodded by Germany, agreed to a landmark investment pact with China, ignoring objections from across the Atlantic and requests from the Biden camp to hold off until the new administration was in office.\n",
            "13: Whether Europe’s decision to effectively de-couple from the U.S. foreign policy agenda before Biden’s administration has really even begun is born out of a desire to achieve the dream of “strategic autonomy,” concern that Donald Trump could return in four years, or some combination thereof may not matter in the end.\n",
            "14: WASHINGTON — Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko denied Sunday that former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma Holdings, a gas company Biden’s son Hunter was a board member of.\n",
            "15: “My absolutely clear answer: no, never,” Poroshenko told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria on “Fareed Zakaria GPS.” “But I also cannot accept that, neither President Obama nor President Biden — Vice President Biden, nor President Trump, nor Vice President Pence never press[ed] me.”\n",
            "16: Poroshenko became president of Ukraine in 2014, the same year that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma, a gas company based in Kyiv.\n",

            "18: Hunter Biden served on the board until early 2019.\n",
            "19: U.S. President Donald Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have claimed, without corroborating evidence, that when he was vice president, Joe Biden inappropriately pressured Ukraine to remove a prosecutor who had launched an investigation into Burisma in order to protect his son.\n",

            "21: A majority of voters said it was inappropriate for Hunter Biden to be employed at Burisma while his father was leading the effort on policy change in Ukraine, according to a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll from February.\n",

            "26: “Would U.S. forces defend the island?” Biden was asked on U.S. television, in an interview published Sunday night.\n",
            "27: The comment was Biden’s most unambiguous yet about U.S. policy toward Taiwan, which has long been governed by the Taiwan Relations Act and the doctrine of “strategic ambiguity” — the notion that the U.S. would remain purposely noncommittal about defending Taiwan.\n",
            "28: Mao Ning said that China had lodged a formal complaint with the U.S. over Biden’s comments, saying Beijing was “strongly dissatisfied,” and adding that the remarks sent a “seriously erroneous signal to Taiwanese separatist independence forces.”\n",
            "29: U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said Tuesday he is not sure Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump “even understands” what NATO’s Article 5 commitment to collective defense means, AFP reported.\n",
            "30: Biden, who is visiting the Latvian capital Riga, said the U.S. had “pledged our sacred honor” to fulfill the NATO requirement to treat an attack against one member country as an attack against all, Reuters reported.\n",
            "31: Biden said Tuesday ahead of talks with the presidents of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, that there was overwhelming bipartisan commitment to NATO in the U.S.\n",
            "32: Joe Biden is right to convene a summit of democracies at a time when autocracies are on the offensive against the free world.\n",
            "33: In her op-ed “Biden’s ‘summit of democracies’ won’t work” (December 8), Shada Islam argues that interests and values often do not align across the free world.\n",
            "34: President-Elect Biden opened the first Copenhagen Democracy Summit and co-founded our Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity to curb election meddling.\n",
            "35: LONDON — Joe Biden inherits a formidable in-tray from Donald Trump — but on trade talks with Britain, plenty of work has already been done.\n",
            "36: One former U.S. official familiar with plans to engage with the U.K. after Biden’s January inauguration said the new administration is expected to take a more gradual and cautious approach to trade overall when compared to the Trump regime.\n",
            "37: On Thursday and Friday, U.S. President Joe Biden will gather leaders from over 100 countries to a virtual “Summit for Democracy.” He invited rule-of-law troublemaker Poland.\n",
            "38: The guest list for Biden’s democracy summit has been a source of speculation since he first floated the idea on the campaign trail.\n",
            "39: BERLIN — Joe Biden took office nearly four years ago on a mission to repair America’s relationship with Europe — and then Vladimir Putin swept in and did it for him.\n",
            "40: Biden is due to arrive in Germany on Thursday night for a brief visit to both celebrate the new spirit of transatlantic solidarity and discuss what the West can do to hamper the Russian president’s progress in Ukraine.\n",
            "41: For all the inevitable talk about the importance of the alliance between their two nations, Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have left the world with a frozen conflict in Ukraine.\n",
            "42: That’s why Biden’s visit to Berlin promises to be more of a counseling session than a valediction.\n",
            "43: Biden later reversed that decision.\n",
            "44: In contrast to Trump, Biden bent over backwards — long before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine — to soothe German fears about Washington’s commitment to their security.\n",
            "45: Just a few weeks after taking office in 2021, Biden participated in the Munich Security Conference, albeit virtually from the White House.\n",
            "46: In the months that followed, Biden appointed a parade of Germany-friendly officials to key positions on the National Security Council and in the State Department.\n",
            "47: In early 2022 Biden dispatched Amy Gutmann as his ambassador to Germany.\n",
            "48: For official Germany, which had spent four years fretting about what special torment Trump might have in store for them next, the rhetoric from Biden and his surrogates was a welcome salve.\n",
            "49: Against that backdrop, the relationship between Biden and Scholz, who took office just weeks before the Russian invasion in February 2022, was close from the get-go.\n",
            "50: “Scholz and Biden’s strategy of boiling the frog slowly in Ukraine did not really work,” said Jana Puglierin, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n",
            "51: If nothing else, Biden’s visit to Berlin — which was originally scheduled for earlier this month but was delayed due to a hurricane in the U.S. — will offer the two leaders time to reflect on what they should have done differently.\n",
            "52: Yet Biden’s farewell trip has mostly generated yawns.\n",
            "53: Scholz’s three-party coalition has been on the rocks for months, and he’s unlikely to serve another term as chancellor; he might even end up ‘doing a Biden’ before Germany’s 2025 election.\n",
            "54: Meanwhile, Biden’s visit, instead of cementing his legacy in Europe, will likely be little more than a reminder of what might have been.\n",
            "55: The Obama administration is sending Vice President Joe Biden to make peace with Turkey.\n",
            "56: Biden’s office on Saturday confirmed reports out of Turkey that he would visit the country on August 24, roughly a month and a half after a failed coup attempt in the strategically located NATO ally.\n",
            "57: Biden will likely attempt to smooth the escalating tensions between Washington and Ankara during his trip.\n",
            "58: Huawei's problems in Western capitals around the world may deepen under U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who is expected to replace Donald Trump's combative diplomacy against the Chinese telecom giant with a more united international effort to keep Beijing from dominating the internet.\n",
            "59: Insiders at Huawei cautiously welcomed Biden's victory in the Nov.\n",
            "60: They also foresee Biden maintaining or even extending the Trump-driven pressure campaign that has crippled Huawei, strained the global telecom sector and dragged others from software giants to chipmakers into the fight.\n",
            "61: Biden is likely to bring “less noise and more content,” said Viviane Reding, former European commissioner for justice who has emerged as a strong critic of Trump’s demands for bans on Huawei in Europe.\n",
            "62: “I hope and expect the Biden administration will show genuine interest in working with allies to create alternatives.\n",
            "63: That kind of coalition means Biden could succeed where Trump didn’t: In building a global coalition of democracies that could join forces politically and on industrial terms to counter China's rise on tech.\n",
            "64: European officials are already working to set up structures to embrace the expected Biden approach.\n",
            "65: While Biden has not detailed a specific Huawei strategy, he has said he will put global cooperation at the center of efforts to counter China’s tech offensive: \"To win the competition for the future against China or anyone else, the United States must sharpen its innovative edge and unite the economic might of democracies around the world,\" Biden wrote in a piece outlining his foreign policy in Foreign Affairs in March.\n",
            "66: “The most effective way to meet that challenge is to build a united front of U.S. allies and partners,” Biden wrote.\n",
            "67: Tony Blinken, Biden’s choice for leading the State Department, told Reuters this summer that Biden would seek to use NATO to address Chinese threats to global security, which could include Huawei’s attempts at making 5G inroads in Europe.\n",
            "68: Or, as Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Biden’s nominee for U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said last week: “America is back.\n",
            "69: The global effect of Trump’s style, according to Pallone, was to “sow doubt and confusion among our partners and allies.” He expects a steadier approach under Biden, with many in Congress ready to partner with the new administration, will be more effective.\n",
            "70: If Biden wants to succeed in bringing back multilateral cooperation, he will have relationships to smooth out.\n",
            "71: In Canada, government insiders anticipate a friendlier stance from Biden, who is politically close to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n",
            "72: But several people inside the Trudeau government say they are not assuming that a Biden White House will make substantive changes in U.S. demands on Canada regarding Huawei.\n",
            "73: Rob Strayer, a former State Department official who spearheaded Trump’s Huawei campaign and now works at tech industry association ITI, argued that “the coalition-building will be not all that different” under Biden.\n",
            "74: But, he added that Biden’s focus would be on working through more formal structures like the G20, G7 or the World Trade Organization and include “the softer form of multilateralism of building a coalition of the like-minded.”\n",
            "75: Biden “will understand these issues,” he added.\n",
            "76: Biden has emphasized U.S.’ and allies’ strengths in research and innovation and his long-term plan to push back on — rather than indulge — protectionist tendencies.\n",
            "77: Those measures are largely expected to remain in place once Biden is in office.\n",
            "78: Steve Berry, who heads a trade group of U.S. rural wireless carriers known as the Competitive Carriers Association and discussed these issues with Biden transition team members last week, expects “no major change” in how the U.S. assesses the dangers of Chinese gear, he said.\n",
            "79: Berry is seeking to secure more than $1.5 billion from U.S. lawmakers now for a subsidy program to help a few dozen rural carriers in the U.S. rid their networks of equipment from Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese telecom company network equipment, a bipartisan issue on Capitol Hill and one he stressed to Biden’s team.\n",
            "80: There are also a number of China hawks in the Senate who could push Biden’s cabinet nominees to take a strong stance on Huawei.\n",
            "81: Senator Marco Rubio (R.-Fla.), a frequent Huawei critic, last week called Biden’s early cabinet picks “polite and orderly caretakers of America’s decline” in a tweet, adding “I have no interest in returning to the ‘normal’ that left us dependent on China.”\n",
            "82: In the U.K., the position is unlikely to change under Biden, Martin said.\n",
            "83: He said even if Biden were to roll back sanctions, the possibility that they could be reinstated would loom.\n",
            "84: If Biden decides to exert less pressure on these countries, it could leave them more wiggle room with how severe they make their restrictions.\n",
            "85: For Biden’s incoming administration, the challenge will be to build actual consensus in the West on how to handle China’s technological rise — without alienating foreign governments with a long list of tech-related issues they want the Biden administration to take on.\n",
            "86: It’s a lot for Biden and allied countries to reconcile as they push back against Chinese technology giants like Huawei.\n",
            "87: If most European leaders now desperately want a new man in the White House — someone who can bring sanity and dignity to the Oval Office and U.S. policies — working with Joe Biden won’t fix what’s ailing the relationship overnight.\n",
            "88: And yet, there are still plenty of potential pitfalls that could come with a Biden presidency.\n",
            "89: That won’t be the case anymore under Biden.\n",
            "90: Biden — despite anti-China rhetoric during his campaign and cross-party support for taking a tough line on Beijing — is likely to be less confrontational and more willing to listen to the EU’s view of China as a systemic rival, competitor and partner.\n",
            "91: That won’t be such a bad development: If Biden does succeed in his ambition to put “America back at the head of the table,” a strong and self-confident Europe with its own networks of power and influence can be a real partner for America — not just a pushover.\n",
            "92: The comments come after it was widely reported that U.S. President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range missiles, also known as the Army Tactical Missile System or ATACMS, for strikes on Russian territory.\n",
            "93: The move marks a major shift in U.S. policy after the Biden administration’s long-standing refusal to agree to Ukraine’s request for authorization to use the missiles to hit targets outside its own borders.\n",
            "94: Biden’s approval came in response to Russia’s use of North Korean troops in the war, The New York Times reported.\n",
            "95: However, Biden’s decision to allow strikes into Russia “will not change” the balance of power on the battlefield, a high-level French military official told reporters Monday.\n",
            "96: Joe Biden’s decision to pull U.S. forces out of Afghanistan by September 11 this year gave NATO allies their marching orders — they had little choice but to salute smartly and declare their troops will follow suit.\n",
            "97: Some officials from the NATO countries most involved in Afghanistan said they appreciated the consultation undertaken by the Biden administration, which contrasted sharply with the rough treatment they suffered under Donald Trump.\n",
            "98: Biden sent his secretaries of state and defense to Brussels this week to discuss the move and they stood shoulder to shoulder with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg to announce it.\n",
            "99: Biden made clear the U.S. and its allies will be gone by September, come what may.\n",
            "100: “President Biden made clear on the campaign trail that he intended to withdraw from the so-called ‘forever war,’ and so this decision was a question of when, not if,” said Joyce Anelay, a former minister in the U.K. Foreign Office who is chair of the House of Lords’ international relations committee.\n",
            "101: Anelay said Biden’s final withdrawal date of September 11 was better that Trump’s planned deadline of May 1.\n",
            "102: James Schwemlein, a former senior adviser to the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan at the U.S. Department of State, said the timeline made an orderly allied withdrawal “very possible.” Schwemlein, now an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, described Biden’s decision as “the best available bad option.”\n",
            "103: U.S. President Joe Biden appointed Pressman envoy to Hungary in 2022.\n",
            "104: Boris Johnson has work to do to woo Joe Biden should he become US president next week.\n",
            "105: LONDON — If Joe Biden wins on Tuesday, corks will pop in many European capitals.\n",
            "106: Prime Minister Boris Johnson has more ground to make up than most in the international race to be Biden’s No. 1 international ally, a station long-desired (and sometimes occupied) by British prime ministers.\n",
            "107: The prime minister's association with Brexit — which Biden strongly opposed — his warm words for Donald Trump, and his past comments about some of Biden’s closest political allies don’t position him well.\n",
            "108: The opposition Labour Party’s Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy told POLITICO that Johnson and his government had “needlessly and repeatedly created tension with the Democrats” — her words a sign that Labour spies a potential weak spot should Biden win, and Johnson fail to strike up a good partnership with him.\n",
            "109: More positively, the U.K. — about to become G7 president, due to hold the UN Security Council presidency in February and hosting the COP26 climate conference in December 2021 — will have ample opportunities in the first 12 months of a Biden administration to demonstrate that, despite Brexit, its broader foreign policy goals fit hand in glove with Biden’s own.\n",
            "110: U.K. officials have struggled, like all diplomats, to gain access to Biden’s inner circle (the Democrat's campaign has observed strict rules over meeting foreign officials to avoid any suggestion of outside influence following the scandal over Russian interference to boost Trump last time around).\n",
            "111: But they remain confident that longstanding ties with Democrats on Capitol Hill, not to mention a dormant Democratic foreign policy establishment currently plying their trade at think tanks and in academia, will help them persuade an incoming Biden administration that there remains more to Britain than Brexit.\n",
            "112: Here's how Johnson's administration might assess some of the key challenges it faces building bridges with a Biden White House:\n",
            "113: U.K. officials deny the government’s Brexit priorities — and the identity of the prime minister — have left British diplomats scrambling to get to know Team Biden.\n",
            "114: But officials also acknowledge privately what observers outside government state plainly: Biden deeply regrets the U.K.’s exit from the EU — and he might not immediately warm to Johnson either.\n",
            "115: \"The Biden team will not have forgotten the rudeness shown by Boris Johnson towards Obama and Hillary Clinton,” said Peter Westmacott, the U.K.’s ambassador to the U.S. from 2012 to 2016.\n",
            "116: However, he said, while the two international agendas won't align on everything, Biden may see Johnson as a \"natural ally\" on several fronts.\n",
            "117: “The personal relationship between Biden and Johnson will be the difficult one,” said former U.K Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind.\n",
            "118: “Biden will be a bit stiff to start off with.\n",
            "119: Biden is deep, deep Irish-American and therefore a bit untrusting of any British politicians with a track record on Ireland; and Johnson unfortunately has created a track record.”\n",
            "120: “Biden, whatever doubts he has about Johnson personally, is long in the tooth,” Rifkind said, and like those predecessors would recognize that despite not seeing eye to eye on everything, the U.K. is a unique friend to have in Europe.\n",
            "121: Biden knows all that.”\n",
            "122: Douglas Lute, a retired U.S. army general who served as ambassador to NATO under Obama from 2013 to 2017, agreed that common interests and military and intelligence ties should not be underestimated when rating the strength of the U.S.-U.K. relationship under a potential Biden administration.\n",
            "123: Biden would want to “refresh” U.S. relations with allies but also “ask more” of them, Lute predicted, “including a renewed emphasis on democratic values and the reimagining of national security to include such challenges as pandemics, climate and cyber.”\n",
            "124: The U.K., as one of only 10 NATO countries spending the target 2 percent of GDP on defense, is likely to be in Biden’s good books on that score, believes Kim Darroch, U.K ambassador to the U.S. from 2016 to 2019.\n",
            "125: He told Spectator TV earlier this month that “repairing the damage to NATO” would be one of Biden’s top two European priorities, alongside repairing relations with the EU.\n",
            "126: “A Biden administration will expect the U.K. to sustain this defense commitment while also playing a leading political role in redefining security to account for new challenges,” he said.\n",
            "127: In one respect, the U.K. has been dealt a good hand in 2021 if it wants to show willing and support Biden’s professed foreign policy goals of renewing alliances between democracies, strengthening international institutions within the UN and taking action on climate change.\n",
            "128: London holds the rotating presidency of the G7 next year, and British officials see an opportunity to align Johnson’s embryonic idea of a expanded “D10” group of democratic allies — G7 nations plus three others, potentially India, South Korea and Australia — with Biden’s plan for a “summit for democracy” early in his term.\n",
            "129: Meanwhile, the U.K. holds the rotating presidency of the United Nations Security Council in February, which would be Biden’s first full month in office.\n",
            "130: Biden, who has vowed to restore U.S. leadership in international health and aid, will — British officials hope — see the U.K. as a useful lieutenant in such efforts.\n",
            "131: With Biden vowing to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on his first day in office and to put the U.S. on the road to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, some spy an opportunity for Johnson to play his right-hand man in drumming up ambitious carbon-cutting pledges from countries around the world.\n",
            "132: “It’s one of the few areas where the U.K. has global influence that the U.S. [under Biden] would want to align with,” said Nick Mabey, CEO of the E3G climate think-tank.\n",
            "133: “Biden has already set out a very ambitious agenda on climate both at home and abroad and would obviously galvanise the international system,” said one U.K. official.\n",
            "134: The key concern for London is not so much that Biden won’t want to do a trade agreement, it’s whether he’ll devote sufficient time and political impetus to the process to wrap it up before a looming deadline.\n",
            "135: “Generally, it’s questionable whether Biden will be as focussed on trade policy or trade deals as Trump has been,\" said Stephen Booth, head of the Policy Exchange think tank’s Britain in the World project and author of a report on the U.S. deal.\n",
            "136: \"It’s fair to say that Biden is unlikely to attach the same importance or urgency to a U.K. deal as Trump.\n",
            "137: Biden might also make more of repairing the U.S.'s political relationship with the EU in the first instance.”\n",
            "138: Should negotiations continue in earnest — and, should he win, U.K. officials will be closely watching to see how quickly Biden appoints a trade representative (which often takes time) — the main sticking points, namely around U.S. food exports, will be the same, Booth expects.\n",
            "139: Some U.K. officials anticipate a Biden administration will also place greater emphasis on labor and environmental protections, but are confident this won’t prove a stumbling block.\n",
            "140: In the longer-term, Booth said, there is a chance Biden will embrace the idea of rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, something which the U.K. is also keen to join in its current revised form and renamed the “Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership” (CPTPP.) “This would present another route to a U.K.-U.S. trade deal,” Booth said.\n",
            "141: U.S. President Joe Biden closed his first virtual summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping with a focus on economic competition, human rights and strategic risks including Taiwan.\n",

            "288: Despite Biden’s promise that the U.S. is a reborn climate leader, veterans of international climate talks told POLITICO that U.S. frugality is one of the biggest impediments to success at November's COP26 climate summit.\n",
            "289: The Biden administration said in April it would double U.S. annual climate finance giving to $5.6 billion.\n",
            "290: “I can assure you that we are looking for ways to go even further toward meeting the collective goal of mobilizing $100 billion a year,” Biden said Friday of his previous commitment to double U.S. climate aid by 2024.\n",
            "291: There were “very big expectations” that when Biden came to office he would pay his “arrears” to the fund, said Mohamed Nasr, an Egyptian diplomat who negotiates climate finance issues on behalf of the African group of nations.\n",
            "292: Governments, chiefly the EU and the U.K., have been privately prodding the Biden administration to up the ante, said Jake Schmidt, senior strategic director of international climate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an NGO.\n",
            "293: Later on the day of von der Leyen's speech, a senior Biden administration official was asked during a press call whether the U.S. planned to increase its climate finance pledge.\n",
            "294: Kerry himself has been optimistic about the prospect of more money, and Biden told G7 leaders in June a “conjectural figure” he anticipated being able to announce before COP26.\n",
            "295: Biden officials have noted Congress controls government spending.\n",
            "296: “They want to do more, they’re looking to do more and given pressure from other countries it wouldn’t shock me if there was an announcement before COP26 relatively soon,” another person who had spoken with Kerry’s team said of the Biden administration’s climate finance ambitions.\n",
            "297: Power was speaking at a press conference on the Armenia-Azerbaijan border, and said she had been sent by U.S. President Joe Biden on a fact-finding mission.\n",
            "298: GENEVA — For the rest of the world, the Back-to-the-Future spectacle of Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin re-enacting Cold War diplomacy offered a clear silver lining: at least America and Russia are talking again, creating a glint of hope that the two presidents might actually be able to do business.\n",
            "299: Biden called the discussion “good, positive.\n",
            "300: Asked if he trusted Putin, Biden put a spin on one of Reagan’s best-known sayings.\n",
            "301: But especially for EU allies counting on Biden to help them escape what European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called a “negative spiral” in relations with Russia, there will now need to be quite a bit of trust that the U.S. leader can forge a partnership with a man who confounded, and at times infuriated, four previous American presidents.\n",
            "302: Biden said that the face-to-face meeting on Wednesday was a crucial start, and suggested he believed he could succeed where others had failed.\n",
            "303: “I know we make foreign policy out to be some great skill somehow, it’s like a secret code,” Biden said.\n",
            "304: In reference to Biden once saying he believed Putin was a killer, the Russian president raised the issue of civilian deaths from U.S. drone strikes in Afghanistan or Iraq.\n",
            "305: But Biden, during his news own conference, made a clear, forceful presentation that appeared to represent the start of an effort to recognize Russia’s interests, while not compromising on Western values, and to erode Putin’s long-practiced victimization routine, in which he insists to his citizens that the U.S. and its allies are simply against Russia and will never change.\n",
            "306: “I told President Putin my agenda is not against Russia or anyone else; it’s for the American people,” Biden said.\n",
            "307: “I also told him that no president of the United States could keep faith with the American people if they did not speak out to defend our democratic values, to stand up for the universal rights and fundamental freedoms that all men and women have, in our view,” Biden said.\n",
            "308: Biden’s approach was a stunning contrast to Donald Trump’s handling of a joint news conference after his own summit with Putin in Helsinki in 2018, where he allowed Putin to speak for him, and for the U.S., and where Trump effectively said he trusted Putin more than his own U.S. intelligence services.\n",
            "309: Biden, by contrast, said he had informed Putin of 16 types of critical infrastructure that he said should be off-limits to cyberattacks, and other red lines such as zero tolerance for election meddling.\n",
            "310: “The bottom line is, I told President Putin that we need to have some basic rules of the road that we can all abide by,” Biden said.\n",
            "311: Biden, by contrast, took questions only from U.S. media outlets.\n",
            "312: And Biden’s assertion that the U.S. does not ever meddle in elections drew snorts, given ample historic evidence that the U.S. has interceded in numerous elections, including in Latin America and the Middle East.\n",
            "313: “I did what I came to do: Number one: identify areas of practical work our two countries can do to advance our mutual interests and also benefit the world,” Biden said.\n",
            "314: Biden was a tad more optimistic.\n",
            "315: In the U.S., some Republicans quickly accused Biden of not being tough enough, especially about Russia’s pattern of malign activity, and for not taking stronger steps, for example, to stop the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project.\n",
            "316: But Samuel Charap, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, said that there was a chance Biden and Putin could build a new relationship and that expecting any contrition, let alone an apology, from Russia was unrealistic.\n",
            "317: President Barack Obama endorsed Joe Biden’s White House bid on Tuesday, formally throwing his support behind his former vice president and the now-presumptive Democratic nominee.\n",
            "318: And that’s why I’m so proud to endorse Joe Biden for president of the United States.”\n",
            "319: Bernie Sanders also endorsed Biden’s candidacy.\n",
            "320: Obama’s endorsement, while widely expected, also represents a new phase in the general election campaign against President Donald Trump, unlocking the Democratic Party’s most powerful surrogate for Biden at a time when his campaign has struggled to cultivate momentum amid the outbreak of the coronavirus in the U.S.\n",
            "321: Although Biden maintained during the primary that he had asked Obama not to endorse any particular Democratic candidate — insisting that “whoever wins this nomination should win it on their own merits” — he relentlessly invoked his eight years of service under the former president and close personal relationship with him to court voters.\n",
            "322: Biden’s efforts to align himself so closely with Obama, even as the previous administration’s policies came under occasional scrutiny from the party’s left flank, were ultimately successful in propelling him past more progressive rivals to become Democrats’ pick to challenge Trump in November.\n",
            "323: His tenure as Obama’s No. 2 also contributed immeasurably to Biden’s firewall of support among African-American voters and proved foundational to the campaign’s argument that the former vice president was a capable, experienced leader ready to assume the responsibilities of the Oval Office.\n",
            "324: Weighing in on the endorsement Tuesday, Brad Parscale, Trump’s reelection campaign manager, asserted that Obama “spent much of the last five years urging Joe Biden not to run for president out of fear that he would embarrass himself,” and now “has no other choice but to support him.”\n",
            "325: “Obama was right in the first place: Biden is a bad candidate who will embarrass himself and his party,” Parscale said in a statement.\n",
            "326: When Biden officially entered the race last April, the former president’s spokeswoman said Obama “relied on the vice president’s knowledge, insight and judgment throughout both campaigns and the entire presidency,” and added that the two men “forged a special bond over the last 10 years.”\n",
            "327: The attorney general will be the latest member of Biden’s Cabinet to make a trip to the war-torn country.\n",
            "328: Campaign representatives for both Joe Biden and President Donald Trump declined to answer questions on their plans for the EU.\n",
            "329: Speaking to French media, he hinted that a Biden presidency could help to defuse mounting tensions over the tax.\n",
            "330: Trump administration officials have been explicit that they will trigger tariffs if any country starts levying the tax, while experts argue that a Biden presidency would be unlikely to take a fundamentally different approach.\n",
            "331: While Biden has said the U.S. should set privacy standards “not unlike the Europeans,” federal privacy legislation would take years to enact, if it is ever approved at all.\n",
            "332: Both Biden and his pick for vice president, Kamala Harris, have been known for taking a friendlier stance toward Big Tech than their counterparts on the left of the Democratic Party.\n",
            "333: That said, Harris has shown interest in addressing algorithmic bias and Biden's campaign promises to \"ensure the technologies of the future like AI are bound by laws and ethics.”\n",
            "334: It’s unclear exactly how Biden will address 5G security, or if he will pursue the Trump administration’s withering anti-Huawei \"Clean Network\" campaign.\n",
            "335: But Biden himself has so far been discrete about his plans on Big Tech, with some saying Europe and the U.S. could come together on lower-hanging fruit: content moderation, for which Biden has advocated regulation, in line with what the EU is doing with the Digital Services Act.\n",
            "336: Joe Biden wants to secure a political agreement with the European Union to restore confidence in data flowing across the Atlantic when he meets leaders in Brussels on June 15, according to five people with knowledge of the talks.\n",
            "337: The deal that Biden is seeking — in the form of a high-level political agreement with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during the upcoming EU-U.S. summit — would lay the groundwork for a new transatlantic data transfer deal, according to the five people, who spoke to Digital Bridge, POLITICO's transatlantic tech newsletter, on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the talks.\n",
            "338: Biden is expected to urge von der Leyen to back a political agreement around a new data transfer agreement, according to sources in both Washington and Brussels.\n",
            "339: Underscoring how much Washington is putting on this diplomatic full-court press, Gina Raimondo, the U.S. commerce secretary, and Katherine Tai, the U.S. trade representative, are expected to join Biden during his visit to Brussels.\n",
            "340: The upcoming trip marks the first time that Biden and von der Leyen will meet in person to hammer out thorny issues from combating climate change to rebuilding the global economy hit by the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
            "341: Since taking office in January, Biden's administration has put forward suggestions to meet the EU's concerns over how the bloc's data is handled in the U.S., according to two individuals with knowledge of the matter who did not provide specifics on the recommendations.\n",
            "342: After the White House proposed including data transfers in the upcoming EU-U.S. summit, two EU officials said they were surprised that the Biden administration was doubling down on the issue when both sides' negotiating teams remained far apart on how best to solve the outstanding issues linked to U.S. government surveillance.\n",
            "343: U.S. President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have “in principle” agreed to hold a bilateral summit followed by a meeting with all relevant parties on the security situation in Europe, after both leaders spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday, the Elysée said.\n",
            "344: Macron’s second call with Putin came after the French president spoke with Biden for around 15 minutes.\n",
            "345: In its readout, the Elysée said Macron had proposed the summit between Biden and Putin, and then with all parties, “to discuss security and strategic stability in Europe,” with Biden and Putin having “both accepted the principle of such a summit.”\n",
            "346: President Biden accepted in principle a meeting with President Putin following that engagement, again, if an invasion hasn’t happened.”\n",
            "347: Vice President Joe Biden took a hard stand against Russian leader Vladimir Putin in a speech at the Brookings Institution Wednesday, saying the situation in Ukraine is a “humanitarian tragedy created by Russian aggression.”\n",
            "348: Biden’s comments did not directly contradict those of Secretary of State John Kerry, who met with his Russian counterpart in Sochi earlier this month, but Biden did strike a tougher tone in dealing with the Russian government.\n",
            "349: But Biden put the onus of Minsk almost entirely on Russia while praising Ukraine’s pro-western government.\n",
            "350: “The United States sanctions on Russia must and will remain in place until the Minsk agreement is fully implemented,” Biden said, adding that there’s “no way to know that until the end of the year.” He also doubled down on America’s commitment to funding Ukrainian military equipment and basic training.\n",
            "351: Biden also decried Russian corruption around the globe, saying that “Russia and others are using corruption and oligarchs as tools.”\n",
            "352: Later in the speech, Biden said tension with Russia over the situation in Ukraine does not mean that the two countries should not cooperate on other global issues, like the nuclear negotiations with Iran and combating terrorism.\n",
            "353: And as world democracies gather virtually at United States President Joe Biden’s Summit for Democracy this week, the invitees — including 26 member countries of the European Union — should view them as such.\n",
            "354: Biden thus understandably opted for a wide tent approach to his list of participants: More than 100 countries will be present at the summit, several of which stand out as weak democracies or visibly display authoritarian traits.\n",
            "355: Indeed, the latter two countries did not even make it onto Biden’s rather generous list of invitations.\n",
            "356: Keir Starmer has denied that Joe Biden is senile or too old to be president of the United States.\n",
            "357: Biden is under increasing pressure to withdraw from the November presidential election, following an often incoherent debate performance last month that put his mental acuity under the spotlight.\n",
            "358: With presidential rival Donald Trump consistently leading in the polls, a growing number of Democratic Congress reps and even actor George Clooney, a major party fundraiser, have said Biden should withdraw from the race.\n",
            "359: Asked during a sit-down interview with the BBC whether the president had appeared “senile” during their meeting, Starmer rejected the suggestion, saying Biden was “absolutely across the detail.”\n",
            "360: It was the first time the U.K’s new prime minister, who was elected last week and is in Washington for the NATO summit, had met Biden.\n",
            "361: Biden is emphatically resisting calls to withdraw from the presidential race and has framed such demands as a struggle between himself and Democratic party “elites,” in a number of interviews and speeches.\n",
            "362: “I don’t care what those big names think,” Biden said during a Monday interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program, after the hosts listed some prominent Democrats who have called on him to step aside.\n",
            "363: Perhaps the easiest way to limit the damage caused by Joe Biden is to play the music from classic TV comedy “Curb Your Enthusiasm” after every public pronouncement.\n",
            "364: Biden, as you will by now be aware, mixed up Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin at the NATO summit (and let’s be clear, Biden could have mixed up Zelenskyy with anyone else in the world — Liz Truss, Darth Vader, the wolf that killed Ursula von der Leyen’s pet pony — and it would have been less embarrassing).\n",
            "365: But if Biden had simply turned to camera, gave a knowing look, perhaps widened his eyes and arched his eyebrows before the “Curb” music kicked in, we might be talking about his comedy genius rather than wondering how on earth this man is going to stop Donald Trump — because if Trump is the lucid one, we’re all screwed.\n",
            "366: And it’s another Italian who could be the person to save Biden and therefore the entire future of Western democracy, if that’s not hyperbole (which it definitely isn’t) … Giorgia Meloni.\n",
            "367: We saw a classic of the genre this week at the NATO summit in which Meloni — waiting for, you’ve guessed it, Biden — gave a ludicrously exaggerated eye-roll before pretending to check a watch she wasn’t wearing.\n",
            "368: So why don’t we simply combine the talents (and I use that word both advisedly and incorrectly) of Biden and Meloni and have her stand next to him during all public events?\n",
            "369: But with the survival of the free world at stake, I ask you to bear with me: this way, when Biden confuses Kamala Harris and Donald Trump — as also happened at NATO — then she can immediately swoop in with a massive eye-roll and everyone will be too busy laughing to realize the awfulness of what’s going on.\n",
            "370: If, for example, Meloni was about to further tighten immigration rules or appoint fans of the Mussolini family to her government, then Biden could cut through the tension by, say, mixing up Emmanuel Macron and François Mitterrand!\n",
            "371: Just look at Joe Biden.\n",
            "372: Biden, though loved by his party faithful, has the dubious distinction of having the lowest approval rating of any president at this stage of his term with the exception of Donald Trump.\n",
            "373: Introducing the Biden Compatibility Index, a ranking of countries according to their affinity to the US president.\n",
            "374: How close are Joe Biden and Europe, really?\n",
            "375: While Biden’s election as U.S. president brought relief in (most) European capitals, it has done little to erode the distrust accumulated during the four years of Donald Trump’s presidency.\n",
            "376: Introducing the Biden Compatibility Index.\n",
            "377: Great move; you made Biden’s day.\n",
            "378: And if you’re one of those countries that would have voted for Trump over Biden, don’t complain when the new guy gives you the stink eye.\n",
            "379: Overall, Biden has plenty of reasons to be happy with how Europe is behaving.\n",
            "380: And try as he might, Biden has had no luck convincing Germany to abandon the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will ship natural gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea.\n",
            "381: The U.S.’s image in Europe has improved substantially after Biden’s inauguration — perhaps not surprisingly, considering his popularity on the Continent was high even prior to his election.\n",
            "382: Whatever trust Biden may have regained, relations aren’t completely rosy.\n",
            "383: Once described by Joe Biden as a Trump “clone,” Johnson gave a Munich Security Conference speech that positioned himself as the optimistic champion of the transatlantic alliance Donald Trump so often scorned.\n",
            "384: In a speech clearly targeted at a Biden administration keen to rebuild ties with European allies, he sought to ease post-Brexit anxieties, insisting “our commitment to European security is unconditional and immoveable” and highlighted how the U.K.’s recent increase in defense spending would make the U.K. the second-biggest NATO contributor after the United States.\n",
            "385: The U.K. prime minister, who as foreign secretary during the Trump era told U.S. diplomats of his belief that the president was indeed “making America great again,” struck a very different tone in one of his first major foreign policy speeches of the Biden era.\n",
            "386: Speaking later at the security conference, which also heard from Biden, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, Johnson deployed another of his political trademarks: insatiable optimism.\n",
            "387: The Biden campaign has been studying the ’18 midterms.\n",
            "388: No, not the ones two years ago when Democrats took over the House by aggressively recruiting moderates and sweeping swing districts across the country, a precursor to Biden’s own centrist strategy in the Democratic presidential primaries this year.\n",
            "389: “We went back and looked at voting in 1918,” said Anita Dunn, one of Biden’s top advisers, “where of course turnout was down, but the election was still held, and Congress was still seated.”\n",
            "390: “Everything that’s happening right now is like nothing I’ve experienced in previous presidential campaigns.” — Anita Dunn, Joe Biden’s top adviser\n",
            "391: The search for historical precedents by Biden’s top strategists to help understand the bizarre new reality of running a presidential campaign in a country gripped by a pandemic underscores how totally the politics of 2020 changed in March.\n",
            "392: Biden’s Philadelphia headquarters has been cleared out.\n",
            "393: “Everybody’s working remotely across the whole campaign,” said Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s communications director.\n",
            "394: The presumed date by which Biden’s delegate nerds predicted Vermont Sen.\n",
            "395: Biden had planned to use a predicted victory in Georgia on Tuesday to essentially end the race by declaring that he had achieved “an insurmountable delegate lead.”\n",
            "396: Instead, the Georgia primary was moved to May and Biden retreated to a makeshift studio in his basement at home in Delaware to broadcast Zoom videos that have had to compete — poorly, so far — with briefings from elected officials like Trump and Gov.\n",
            "397: With many remaining primaries getting kicked to May and June, Biden might not be able to deliver his “insurmountable delegate lead” line until the summer.\n",
            "398: And while the pandemic has essentially erased Sanders from the news, there is an undercurrent of frustration — and a little nervousness — among some Biden aides that he has been robbed of a clean victory as the presumptive nominee at the end of March, as they had assumed he would.\n",
            "399: “There’s no closure,” said a top Biden adviser.\n",
            "400: The pandemic exploded and inserted itself as the only issue that matters just as Biden made his remarkable transition from lost cause to incredible comeback.\n",
            "401: The rebound was so swift and his dominance over the race so sudden, that a lot of Biden advisers and outside allies are still processing what happened.\n",
            "402: Did Biden build an excellent team that just took some time to get things right?\n",
            "403: Or was Biden’s team hapless and he was simply the beneficiary of underlying dynamics in the primary that allowed him to beat Sanders?\n",
            "404: “After Super Tuesday, Biden got catapulted to the front of the line in spite of himself and his campaign,” he said.\n",
            "405: Biden clearly agreed that some version of this analysis was accurate: He replaced his campaign manager on March 12, after a string of victories made it clear he would be the nominee.\n",
            "406: The Biden campaign has not quite figured out what will replace the traditional set piece events of a presidential campaign.\n",
            "407: For now, in the teeth of the crisis, when attention is necessarily focused on the people in charge, Biden has two big problems.\n",
            "408: former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden holds a virtual campaign event on March 13 in Chicago.\n",
            "409: “Biden has a thin line,” the outside adviser to Biden said.\n",
            "410: Then there’s the issue of Biden being denied one of his political strengths.\n",
            "411: Biden thrives on personal connection; the pandemic has robbed him of the ability to meet with actual people.\n",
            "412: But we talk about the day, and we hang out,” Biden told Jake Tapper on Tuesday.\n",
            "413: “There are other Democrats who think all of the hand-wringing over Biden’s bizarre situation and the complexities and political downside of creating a virtual campaign are overblown.”\n",
            "414: “We’re thinking through what does a virtual campaign look like, and how do we ensure that Biden is able to have that one-on-one connection that he is able to form with voters when he’s out in the real world,” said Bedingfield.\n",
            "415: Next up, launching on Monday, is a regular podcast that Biden will host with a one-on-one conversation format.\n",
            "416: Biden stumbled to victory with a nearly broke campaign.\n",
            "417: Those twin developments have many Democrats concerned that Biden’s fundraising has dramatically stalled.\n",
            "418: The Biden campaign acknowledged it was a serious concern.\n",
            "419: “We are preparing for and thinking through how we execute the campaign knowing that it’s very possible that fundraising across the board, and not just for our campaign, it’s just gonna be leaner than it might have been a few months ago,” said a Biden adviser.\n",
            "420: But there are other Democrats who think all of the hand-wringing over Biden’s bizarre situation and the complexities and political downside of creating a virtual campaign are overblown.\n",
            "421: Across Europe, the congratulations for U.S. President-elect Joe Biden started flowing within minutes of the race being called, but it was clear that European leaders were also toasting themselves, the end of the Trump era, and the prospect of a renewal of transatlantic relations.\n",
            "422: With President Donald Trump still claiming fraud and refusing to concede, many European leaders cast aside caution and diplomatic protocol to swiftly send their good wishes to Biden, the former vice president and longtime senator who is well known across the Continent.\n",
            "423: “I want to congratulate the new President Elect of the USA Joe Biden,” Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin tweeted at 5:37 p.m. Central European Time, just 15 minutes after CNN became the first news network to project the Democratic nominee had finally won after four days of vote counting.\n",
            "424: “Biden has been a true friend of this nation throughout his life and I look forward to working with him in the years ahead,” Martin wrote.\n",
            "425: In a fuller statement, Martin noted Biden’s Irish family heritage.\n",
            "426: “This is a particularly special day for the people of County Louth and of County Mayo who count President-elect Biden among their own,” he said.\n",
            "427: But it was less the family connection and more Biden’s repeated statements in support of the Good Friday Agreement and, more broadly, U.S. Democrats’ backing of Ireland in the context of Brexit that gave Martin reasons to take the lead among Europeans wishing well to Biden, and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris.\n",
            "428: “While some of the processes are still playing out, it is now clear Joe Biden has won,” Raab tweeted.\n",
            "429: “Congratulations Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\n",
            "430: “I warmly congratulate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for their victory in the U.S. Presidential elections,” Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.\n",
            "431: I look forward to working with President-elect Biden.”\n",
            "432: On this basis the EU congratulates President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on reaching enough Electoral Votes.”\n",
            "433: NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who spent much of the past four years trying to keep Trump on board with the alliance, made clear he expected no such struggle with Biden.\n",
            "434: “I warmly welcome the election of Joe Biden as the next President of the United States,” Stoltenberg said in a statement.\n",
            "435: “I know Mr. Biden as a strong supporter of NATO and the transatlantic relationship.”\n",
            "436: “Things will not just go back where they were.” Still, she pronounced herself as “feelin good” about Biden’s victory.\n",
            "437: As his colleagues congratulated Biden, Janša noted that there was a still a court fight ahead, and that it was the mainstream media, not election officials, who had declared the winner.\n",
            "438: U.S. Vice President Joe Biden is leaving his options open for 2020.\n",
            "439: After presiding over the Senate Tuesday, where a cancer-treatment bill was renamed to honor his late son Beau, Biden spoke to reporters about his final days in the Senate before saying he was “going to run again.”\n",
            "440: Biden was asked if he was kidding about running.\n",
            "441: I learned a long time ago fate has a strange way of intervening,” Biden said.\n",
            "442: Biden considered running for president this year, but decided against it after Beau died from cancer in May 2015.\n",
            "443: European Council President Charles Michel will invite U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to participate in a videoconference with EU heads of state and government, perhaps even before the January 20 inauguration, a senior EU official said Tuesday.\n",
            "444: Michel’s willingness to put aside formalities reflects just how thrilled most European leaders are about Biden’s victory and the prospect of renewing transatlantic relations, which frayed badly during the Trump years.\n",
            "445: Biden has pledged to rejoin the Paris climate accords, reversing a Trump decision from early in his term that had left many EU leaders deeply distressed.\n",
            "446: European leaders are also hoping that Biden will help renegotiate the Iran nuclear agreement, restore comity to trade relations, and generally reintroduce a level of civility in the discourse that has been absent in the years since Trump declared the EU a “foe” that had long taken advantage of the U.S.\n",
            "447: On Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she looked forward to working with Biden and recalled good interactions with him when he served as vice president.\n",
            "448: Word of Michel’s planned invitation came as Biden made an initial round of calls to European leaders.\n",
            "449: More than a year after the controversial U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell resigned his post, the German news magazine Der Spiegel has reported that U.S. President Joe Biden plans to nominate Amy Gutmann, president of the University of Pennsylvania, for the role.\n",
            "450: Still, she brings some experience in politics — she served as head of former President Barack Obama’s Bioethics Commission — and has come into frequent contact with Biden via his close ties to Penn.\n",
            "451: While vice president under Obama, Biden kicked off his 2016 “Cancer Moonshot” program at Penn’s Abramson Cancer Center, and accepted an honorary professorship post at the university after leaving the White House in 2017.\n",
            "452: Biden also helped found the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, D.C., in 2018.\n",
            "453: Officials on both sides have been eager to repair relations since Biden took over, even as a handful of significant policy differences remain.\n",
            "454: On a swing through Europe last month, the first international trip of his presidency, Biden underscored his commitment to U.S. re-engagement on the global stage.\n",
            "455: Still, Biden’s presidency hasn’t returned things to their pre-Trump normal: Germany remains wary of relying on the U.S. as a long-term strategic partner, advocating for the European Union to take a more active role in charting its own future.\n",
            "456: Nominating a well-established academic like Gutmann — particularly one who has extensive expertise on democracy issues — sends a signal that Biden is serious about his stated focus on shoring up democracies around the world.\n",
            "457: At the same time, she added, “I think the Biden administration wants to know where Germany stands … This balancing act, which has happened for quite a long time now, is not sustainable.”\n",
            "458: But Joe Biden’s brief visit to Northern Ireland across Tuesday night and Wednesday — 18 hours total, about half of them in bed — featured none of the gaffes that have previously blotted his diplomatic copybook.\n",
            "459: Wednesday’s gathering at Ulster University in Belfast brought Northern Ireland’s opposing political leaders — including the key figure blocking the revival of power-sharing, Democratic Unionist chief Jeffrey Donaldson — side by side at last, along with a selfie-shooting Biden.\n",
            "460: And instead of extolling his famous Irish Catholic roots, Biden’s speech noted the English and Protestant elements of his family tree, and the disproportionate contribution of Ulster Scots immigrants to the foundation of the United States.\n",
            "461: “The family ties, the pride, those Ulster Scots immigrants who helped found and build my country, they run very deep,” Biden told the audience.\n",
            "462: If Biden had punches to throw in the Democratic Unionists’ direction, he pulled them.\n",
            "463: Speaking to POLITICO, a visibly relieved Donaldson said afterward that he’d appreciated the president’s “measured and balanced remarks” — and distanced himself from his unionist colleagues’ pointed criticisms of Biden as a poodle to Irish nationalism and even the outlawed IRA.\n",
            "464: He also rebuffed a claim by his predecessor as DUP leader, Arlene Foster, that Biden “hates the United Kingdom,” stating: “The United Kingdom and the United States have a strong alliance and we want to build on that.”\n",
            "465: He noted that Biden’s speech diplomatically avoided assigning blame for the Stormont impasse and focused on making a better Northern Ireland for today’s Ulster University students, who are too young to remember the three decades of bloodshed that ended following paramilitary cease-fires in the mid-1990s.\n",
            "466: But Murphy added: “Biden’s pitch is about the future.\n",
            "467: Most of those present agreed that, even though some leaders had wanted Biden to visit the Stormont parliament building overlooking Belfast, the president’s decision not to do so meant their failure to form a new government hadn’t become the central image of the visit.\n",
            "468: The assembly’s caretaker speaker, Alex Maskey, also from Sinn Féin, agreed that in hindsight, Biden was probably right to have declined his own invitation to visit what is essentially Ground Zero of Northern Ireland’s political dysfunction.\n",
            "469: While Biden strikingly spent less than a day in Belfast before crossing the border to spend the rest of the week touring the Republic of Ireland, he left behind his new envoy to Northern Ireland, Joe Kennedy III, who will spend the next 10 days building business and political contacts across the U.K. region.\n",
            "470: Kennedy insisted Biden hadn’t needed to spend too much time in Belfast talking to local leaders this week — because he’d just had all of them, including Donaldson, as guests to the White House for St. Patrick’s Day.\n",
            "471: Even by the shameless standard of attempting to claim every American president as Irish, Joe Biden’s April 2023 visit to Ireland was remarkable — not because of the U.S. president’s genuine affection for the land of his great-great-grandfather, but because the three-day agenda read more like a prolonged family bonding retreat than a serious attempt at forging deeper transatlantic ties.\n",
            "472: In reality, Biden’s view of Ireland — mired in his ancestors’ escape from poverty, washed down with a heady dose of prose and poetry — represents an increasingly distant part of Irish-American folklore.\n",
            "473: The issue here isn’t about diluting Ireland’s links to the U.S., or forgetting the importance of Irish America — as Biden well knows, shared history is a cultural centerpiece of identity.\n",
            "474: It’s why Biden must be the last Irish-American president.\n",
            "475: WASHINGTON — EU leaders in Washington for a summit with U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday had an important objective: projecting a united front after days of mixed messages on the Israel crisis.\n",
            "476: European Council President Charles Michel, who is visiting the White House for the first time, will hold a bilateral meeting with Biden in the Oval Office ahead of the EU-U.S. summit.\n",
            "477: Though Michel is formally charged with representing the EU on the global stage, it is von der Leyen who has the deeper relationship with the Biden administration, a link solidified during the run-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 when the Commission chief and her team worked closely with the White House on coordinating sanctions.\n",
            "478: She has met Biden several times.\n",
            "479: Michel previously took issue with von der Leyen’s stance on China, amid suspicions that the EU’s executive was overly swayed by the position of the Biden administration.\n",
            "480: Biden is set to reverse Trump’s withdrawal from the WHO, but in the meantime, Europe has stepped up to the plate.\n",
            "481: U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rescind his country's planned withdrawal from the WHO on his first day in office, but his predecessor has left him a vastly changed political space.\n",
            "482: Trump meanwhile, has refused to join COVAX and Biden's team is expected to hold talks with the alliance.\n",
            "483: Biden has made clear his commitment to global health and the WHO, tweeting in July: “Americans are safer when America is engaged in strengthening global health.\n",
            "484: His campaign website states that he will call for “fully resourcing the WHO, especially its Contingency Fund for Emergencies.” But in the four years that Biden has been out of the White House, much work on global health has been undone.\n",
            "485: It’s expected that Biden will repeal the policy once he is in office — a move welcomed by many working in global health.\n",
            "486: The financing of global health will be one of Biden’s first challenges, said Kickbusch.\n",
            "487: Kickbusch said that it isn’t clear how Biden will address this, nor how he will go about future funding of the WHO.\n",
            "488: A Biden presidency could pave the way for strengthened relations between the EU and the U.S., with global health issues set to continue to dominate the headlines for months to come.\n",
            "489: U.S. President Joe Biden “absolutely” supports European allies developing their own, stronger military capabilities — but it’s high time for EU leaders to move beyond theory and rhetoric, State Department Counselor Derek Chollet told POLITICO on a visit to Brussels.\n",
            "490: The push for increased European military prowess, often called “strategic autonomy,” got a boost from Biden this fall after his administration infuriated France by announcing a surprise Indo-Pacific security partnership with the U.K. and Australia.\n",
            "491: As part of his effort to patch up relations with French President Emmanuel Macron, Biden agreed to support a raft of joint security and defense initiatives, which they discussed on the sidelines of the recent G20 summit in Rome and detailed in a joint statement.\n",
            "492: His trip to the Bosnian capital coincided with the 26th anniversary of the Dayton signing, and Chollet said he carried a “pretty stern message” from the Biden administration, warning the country’s leaders against provocative language, including some suggesting a breakup of the country.\n",
            "493: Chollet noted that numerous U.S. officials, including Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, had spent time earlier in their careers working to help bring peace to the former Yugoslavia.\n",
            "494: But if Chollet is a veritable in-house scribe of State Department history, he noted the unhappy precedent of having so few of Biden’s ambassadors confirmed by the Senate, partly the result of a Republican blocking campaign, and fueled by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.\n",
            "495: In the interview, Chollet described the backlog in ambassador confirmations as evidence of the larger political polarization and gridlock that has gripped the U.S. in recent years and worsened during the four years of Donald Trump’s presidency, which he said created “a lot of uncertainty and guessing about where the U.S. is headed.” Biden, he argued, has “tried to spend the first 10 months resetting a bit.”\n",
            "496: Chollet said that Biden, like former President Barack Obama, was wrestling with an ever-more complicated, multipolar global system and trying to repair the damage at home and abroad: “Now, we’ve got the rise of China, we had a pandemic, and that we’re still struggling with, of course, and deeper domestic dysfunction in the United States.”\n",
            "497: And Biden must give attention to that dysfunction, he said.\n",
            "498: A split is emerging at the very top of the European Union over the bloc’s China policy, amid growing pressure from U.S. President Joe Biden for Brussels to take a more hawkish stance toward Beijing.\n",
            "499: Senior figures in the European Council — including President Charles Michel — are pushing for a less confrontational approach to China than that of the Biden administration, which is trying to pressure allies to team up in taking on Beijing.\n",
            "500: In particular, there is concern within the European Council about the joint statement issued by von der Leyen and Biden following their meeting in the White House last Friday.\n",
            "501: But the U.S. has indicated that Biden won’t attend a summit in Europe before June — a sequence of events that will delay the next EU-China summit until the second half of the year.\n",
            "502: Von der Leyen herself has struck up a strong professional relationship with Biden.\n",
            "503: Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel was also reluctant to toe the line on U.S. policy regarding China — infuriating Sullivan and incoming members of the Biden administration during the transition period between the Trump and Biden presidencies, when she helped drive an EU trade pact with China in December 2020.\n",
            "504: LONDON — If the first weeks of 2021 are anything to go by, the United States under Joe Biden will present a wholly different face to the world.\n",
            "505: Still, Biden’s priorities are becoming clearer.\n",
            "506: Biden is “very focused” on addressing climate change, he pointed out, “as is Boris Johnson” with Britain's hosting of the COP26 climate conference in November.\n",
            "507: “The U.S., under President Biden, is likely to introduce a tariff regime that encourages sustainable trade,” said Rebecca Harding, chief executive of Coriolis Technologies.\n",
            "508: And it is worth watching “what the Biden administration does on carbon border taxes,” said Tim Figures, a senior expert on geopolitics and trade at the Boston Consulting Group, late last year.\n",
            "509: Such rifts could potentially dilute the West’s response, and Holmes said a top priority for Biden “will be the desire to mend fences with the EU and to find a better way to respond to China.\" Is there a way for the U.K. to play a diplomatic role in between?\n",
            "510: On Wednesday Britain’s trade secretary Liz Truss clearly echoed Biden as she called for an alliance of free-trading democracies — including the United States and Japan — to protect global trading rules.\n",
            "511: If the U.K. can turn its gaze from Brexit, Holmes said, “we will need to respond to the Biden trade agenda.” Trade agreements will be at the bottom of the new president's priorities, he added, and “a separate trade deal with the U.K. will be relatively unimportant.”\n",
            "512: But Biden’s trade team led by U.S. Trade Representative nominee Katherine Tai will still need to get into position.\n",
            "513: The U.K. is working to entice the Biden administration back to the table by promising to go further on the deal’s sustainability provisions.\n",
            "514: Yet dealing with the domestic economic aftermath of COVID-19 and all the other burning issues left by the Trump administration will cause the deal to “fall down the political agenda,” said Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, shortly after Biden’s election.\n",
            "515: In an early move, Biden and Tai may “roll back some of the Trump tariffs,” said Dan Griswold, a senior trade research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center, a free-market think tank.\n",
            "516: Truss repeatedly raised the issue in U.K.-U.S. trade negotiations with Lighthizer — and Britain now looks to the Biden administration for the next move.\n",
            "517: “We are so lucky to have the European Union as a partner in what we do,” U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who personally delivered the late-May Valentine on behalf of President Joe Biden, said Wednesday evening.\n",
            "518: EU leaders, officials and diplomats are generally thrilled to have Biden in office instead of Donald Trump.\n",
            "519: But some have complained that the U.S. is also back to its friendly exceptionalism, occasionally taking decisions with minimal or no consultation, such as Biden’s unexpected support for lifting patent protections for coronavirus vaccines.\n",
            "520: But she also praised the quick action by Brussels and noted Biden had applauded it and intended to follow up with U.S. measures.\n",
            "521: Liz Truss predicted Joe Biden will never do a trade deal with the United Kingdom.\n",
            "522: Truss told the Heritage Foundation think tank in Washington D.C.: \"There will not be a U.S.-U.K. trade deal under Joe Biden.\n",
            "523: Speaking Monday, she contrasted Biden's attitude to a deal with his predecessor Donald Trump, who she's rowing in behind in November's U.S. presidential election.\n",
            "524: Biden's administration shelved separated plans for a more limited, \"foundational\" trade agreement last December after Senate opposition and disagreements over the deal's scope.\n",
            "525: European diplomats and officials have described their shock at President Joe Biden’s faltering, error-strewn public performances and revealed they have already started reaching out to Donald Trump.\n",
            "526: With his poll numbers in decline, Biden is under mounting pressure from his own supporters to step aside in favor of a younger candidate like Vice President Kamala Harris to take on Trump at November’s presidential election.\n",
            "527: First, there was Biden’s stumble at the presidential TV debate last month, in which he lost his train of thought, triggering a wave of soul-searching among Democrats and others who worry what a new Trump term will bring.\n",
            "528: Then, on Thursday, came Biden’s long press conference at the close of the NATO summit in Washington, during which he insisted he was fit enough to serve another term and the best person to beat Trump.\n",
            "529: When Biden introduced Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy as “President Putin,” there was an audible gasp among Europeans in the room.\n",
            "530: Nobody mentioned it with the Biden team afterward.”\n",
            "531: The Trump outreach has accelerated, another diplomat said, and predates Biden’s latest gaffes.\n",
            "532: The NATO summit marked the first meeting of Biden and new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to reaffirm the so-called “special relationship” between the United Kingdom and the United States.\n",
            "533: “It is now clear that Joe Biden sticking to his candidacy will only help Trump,” said Roderich Kiesewetter, a prominent Christian Democrat lawmaker on the Foreign Affairs Committee in Berlin.\n",
            "534: “It can only be hoped that the Democrats will find a way for Joe Biden to withdraw while saving face and that Kamala Harris, for example, will become the Democrats’ frontrunner.”\n",
            "535: But look closer, and it turns out that on everything from trade and taxes to coronavirus vaccines, U.S. President Joe Biden is transpiring to be every inch as much of a pain in Brussels' bureaucratic backside as his predecessor — hitting the EU exactly where it hurts, while robbing it of the moral high ground it loves to occupy.\n",
            "536: Biden's bombshell proposal to waive intellectual property rights on coronavirus vaccines is a perfect case in point, as the EU is now floundering in the PR war, all too conscious that it has suddenly been turned into a cartoon villain, advocating the rights of Big Pharma against poor nations.\n",
            "537: \"The real change is that the Biden administration, to our biggest astonishment also including mine, is really changing the overall narrative on these issues, which we didn't think he would,\" said Kathleen Van Brempt, a Belgian member of the European Parliament and the Socialist group's point person on trade.\n",
            "538: In only a few months, Biden has exposed both the folly in the EU's trade policy toward China and Europe's lack of ambition in plans to tax digital multinationals.\n",
            "539: Infuriatingly for the Europeans, while the superficial political optics have improved, Biden's turning out to be just as hard as Trump on issues the EU really cares about, like Germany's plans to buy gas from Russia through the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.\n",
            "540: While Biden has moved to defuse a long-standing tariff clash over subsidies for Airbus and Boeing, the new president has also left much of Trump's trade policy untouched, including tariffs on steel and a blockade of the World Trade Organization's court system.\n",
            "541: Biden's drive for a \"Buy American\" policy, favoring U.S. companies in major public tenders, is even drawing countermeasures from the EU camp.\n",
            "542: Biden's surprise move to publicly back India and South Africa's call for a waiver on the intellectual property of coronavirus vaccines was just the latest example in a set of maverick moves that not only run counter to the EU's economic interests, but that — unlike Trump — also called the bluff of Brussels' supposedly progressive leadership.\n",
            "543: In a sign that even France, which officially backed the IP waiver, was not amused by the Biden administration's volte-face, Junior Europe Minister Clément Beaune told POLITICO that it was a \"very political move, because so far they have exported nothing\" in terms of vaccines.\n",
            "544: But Van Brempt from the European Parliament pointed out that Biden had exposed Brussels' failure to act.\n",
            "545: China has been another highly strategic area where the U.S. has made the EU look hypocritical for pontificating about \"European values.\" Led by Germany and its all-important car industry, the EU rushed into a trade deal with Beijing at the end of last year, brushing off concerns about human rights and requests from the incoming Biden administration to consult on the agreement.\n",
            "546: While it was Trump's Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who first labeled China's persecutions of Uyghurs in Xinjiang a \"genocide,\" the Biden administration doubled down by formalizing the designation in a report — piling moral pressure on EU countries to also take a stand, and turning the eyes of the world to German carmaker Volkswagen's factory in the region.\n",
            "547: As with the steel tariffs and WTO blockage, Biden has kept the stick and largely continued Trump's policies.\n",
            "548: But, unlike Trump, Biden is simultaneously winning the moral high ground.\n",
            "549: In another curveball move last month, Biden blindsided EU leaders.\n",
            "550: Biden's plan to tax the 100 largest companies in the world would include the likes of Google and Facebook, but also non-digital giants such as Volkswagen and French oil and gas giant Total.\n",
            "551: \"My impression is that also our French friends in Paris are very much impressed [by Biden's tax initiative] and will give him a chance,” Altmaier said diplomatically.\n",
            "552: Van Brempt from the Socialists said all these moves from Biden ramped up pressure on the EU to become more coherent.\n",
            "553: U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Friday called on President Donald Trump to make public a July phone call at the center of a report that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to find dirt on Biden’s family.\n",
            "554: “If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country,” Biden said in a statement.\n",
            "555: Biden’s comments come after a report that Trump pressured Ukrainian officials to investigate a potential political opponent — a call that reportedly prompted a whistleblower complaint by a member of the intelligence community that has been stonewalled from congressional review.\n",
            "556: Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani admitted Thursday evening to asking Ukraine to investigate Biden during a rambling — and at times contradictory — interview, having previously claimed that Biden as vice president tried to shield his son Hunter from investigation over ties with a Ukrainian gas company.\n",
            "557: Biden has denied those allegations.\n",
            "558: Trump said the contents of his phone call with the Ukrainian president were “totally appropriate,” but did not answer whether he asked to investigate Biden, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the nature of the phone call.\n",
            "559: Biden, but his state media agents of chaos sprung into action.\n",
            "560: Russian President Vladimir Putin enjoyed a lie-in on Friday instead of watching the debate between U.S. President Joe Biden and Republican challenger Donald Trump.\n",
            "561: Biden’s halting performance alarmed allies and triggered calls from Democrats that he should pull out of the election race.\n",
            "562: State news agency RIA published a tally of how often the two candidates mentioned the name “Vladimir Putin” (seven times for both) and Russia (Trump: 16, Biden: 0).\n",
            "563: Russian media also zeroed in on Biden’s comments that the Kremlin would not limit itself to conquering Ukraine and wanted to “re-establish what was part of the Soviet Empire,” and his description of Putin as a “war criminal.”\n",
            "564: “Biden expectedly misspoke multiple times and stammered, Democrats have already called his performance a failure,” state news agency RIA concluded, leaving Trump out of its crosshairs altogether.\n",
            "565: Several Russian media outlets also ran separate stories on Trump’s statement that “Ukraine’s not winning that war” and suffering heavy losses — a message that will be well received by many Russians — because of Biden “and his stupid decisions.”\n",
            "566: Putin has said in the past that he prefers Biden to Trump because he’s “more experienced, more predictable” — but whether that’s a real endorsement for the man who called Putin a “killer” is questionable.\n",

            "728: The report is likely to generate attention in part because the Center for American Progress has become known as a training ground for Biden administration officials, with dozens of the think tank’s alumni now in positions at the White House, the State Department, the Pentagon and other government agencies.\n",
            "729: The think tank’s former president and chief executive, Neera Tanden, recently joined the White House as a senior adviser to Biden, a role that might make her even more powerful than budget director, the post for which she was initially nominated but withdrew when it became clear she could not win Senate confirmation.\n",

            "859: Should Biden decide to run, Obama would be in an almost impossible position himself.\n",
            "860: Obama seemed confident enough that Biden would skip the race to go short of endorsing Clinton outright, and now people who know the president acknowledge just how tough it would be for him to tell a man he truly considers a brother to follow his heart without giving his own realistic assessment of the height of the mountain he’d have to climb.\n",
            "861: Add to that the Biden world’s apparent expectation that Obama would be supportive, Obama’s own genuine affection for Clinton and the president having to spend the next eight months tiptoeing around implying either one of them is ahead in the battle for his legacy, and it gets even tougher.\n",
            "862: “Anyone who has worked there loves Joe Biden.\n",

            "864: Obama was on vacation in Martha’s Vineyard for the last two weeks as the Biden speculation and early exploration ramped up, but senior staffers still haven’t gotten together to talk through what a candidacy would actually mean, both in terms of internal logistics and the political navigation.\n",
            "865: They anxiously watched her struggling during the press conference about her private email server last week, and the combination of that and Biden floating out there has them thinking.\n",
            "866: Bring up Biden with many current and former Obama staffers, and conversation stops.\n",

            "877: While the Airbus-Boeing dispute is a long-running sore, Biden's more imminent problem is that there is another hefty tranche of EU duties coming.\n",
            "878: While both the EU and U.S. have said they would like to avoid that escalation, there is no immediate way out of this crunch because Biden faces internal pressure from steelmakers, unions and some parts of his party to maintain the steel tariffs.\n",
            "879: Biden's challenge is that removing Trump's steel tariffs would open him up to accusations from industry and unions that he is weaker on trade enforcement than Republicans.\n",
            "880: One reason Biden defeated Trump in November was that he won back some of the blue-collar voters who abandoned Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n",
            "881: Similarly, in Brussels, there is little appetite to stop the tariff hike unless Biden removes the tariffs.\n",
            "882: And I think what President Biden has said is we’re going to have a whole of government review of all of these policies and decide what it makes sense to maintain.”\n",

            "919: After the trauma of the Trump years, many European decision-makers will see the Biden presidency as a golden opportunity not just to repair the transatlantic alliance but to renew and redefine it for the coming decades.\n",
            "920: Not that Biden would be an easy partner.\n",
            "921: Whatever his sympathies for Europe, Biden, like Barack Obama before him, will make it clear that the Europeans need to stop talking and start doing if they want an equal partnership with the U.S. and help avoid a return to Trumpism four years from now.\n",

            "923: While that tone will get friendlier, the Biden administration is unlikely to return to the status quo ante overnight.\n",
            "924: That means that while it might be easier to seal a trade arrangement with the Biden administration, it won’t be an easy negotiation, especially considering that the U.S. trade deficit with Europe has ballooned to over $170 billion.\n",
            "925: That said, Biden could open the door to renewing a transatlantic free trade agreement.\n",
            "926: Biden’s victory came too late to stop the U.S. from leaving the Paris climate deal, but that doesn’t mean that he can’t reenter it as soon as he takes office.\n",
            "927: It’s an issue that Biden has made clear he takes seriously, going as far as to signal during the campaign that he sees the U.S. phasing out its reliance on oil and gas over the long term.\n",

            "931: Bottom line: In the face of growing public unease over China’s crackdown in Hong Kong and its use of concentration camps to intimidate its Muslim population, Biden’s Washington is likely to prevail.\n",
            "932: The pledge NATO countries made in 2014 to move toward spending 2 percent of GDP on defense will remain on the agenda under Biden — even if he’s bound to be less nasty than Trump was about reminding Europeans that many countries (chiefly Germany) haven’t been pulling their weight.\n",
            "933: Biden will also make clear that with the U.S. shifting its attention to China, Europe is going to have to lead the effort on the Continent to counter Russian and Chinese attempts to establish a foothold.\n",
            "934: While Biden has been vocal in stressing the necessity of confronting Russian aggression, he sees China as the long-term threat.\n",
            "935: That could make it more difficult for Biden to flip a switch to reverse Trump’s decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal, especially if doing so threatened the recent improvement.\n",
            "936: While the EU, which regards the deal as one of its great diplomatic achievements, has clung to the pact and is anticipating a U.S. return under Biden, it could be a tough sell in the U.S., even among Democrats.\n",
            "937: Bottom line: Biden will probably attempt some form of rapprochement with Iran, but a full return to the nuclear deal is unlikely.\n",
            "938: Behind the scenes, the Biden administration was urging Benjamin Netanyahu to delay launching the offensive — a bid to run the clock, hoping the passing of time might lead Israel to scale back its military plans.\n",
            "939: Characteristically, U.S. President Joe Biden has been inconsistent, trying to have it all ways.\n",
            "940: Two weeks ago, when asked what the chances were for a cease-fire in Gaza, Biden was in warrior mode and dismissive.\n",
            "941: But less than a week later, while in Nantucket, Massachusetts for Thanksgiving, that was all forgotten and Biden struck a different chord saying “the chances are real” that the pause could open the door to a longer cease-fire.\n",
            "942: Admittedly, Biden hasn’t talked yet of a permanent cease-fire and he’s linked any truces to the release of hostages.\n",
            "943: But the change in the mood music was striking and has been noted in Israel, where there’s rising anxiety that the Biden administration is making electoral calculations swayed by progressive Democrats, Arab leaders and Europeans.\n",
            "944: Politicians across the ideological spectrum in Israel are always careful to praise Biden publicly, but most are suspicious of the U.S. president, noting his inconstancy and his long-established pattern to talk grandiosely but act cautiously.\n",
            "945: In fact, the quip doing the rounds in Tel Aviv is that “Biden is your best friend, until he isn’t.”\n",
            "946: Joe Biden’s problem is they’re weak.\n",
            "947: Even with Biden robustly proclaiming his commitment to NATO, the harsh reality of Europe’s unreadiness could create tensions within the alliance that are even more difficult to smooth over than Trump’s badgering of allies to increase their military spending — something they had all pledged to do at a leaders’ summit in Wales in 2014.\n",
            "948: In recent days, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has sought to assure the Biden administration that he shares the priority being placed on China, just as he repeatedly sought to assure Trump he was pressing for more spending.\n",
            "949: Stoltenberg has also stressed that China should be brought into discussions on nuclear arms control, echoing a view widely held among Biden’s security team.\n",
            "950: “Biden has been much more eloquent, much more diplomatic than Trump has, but the threat perception is so vastly different that I see a huge problem for NATO’s cohesion to be emerging.\n",
            "951: But even if all allies came around to the U.S. point of view on China, claiming consensus with Biden is cheap and easy compared to preparing European militaries for faraway missions.\n",
            "952: Instead, they rely on the U.S. for security and are now preparing to exit Afghanistan by September 11, a deadline set by Biden, even as some allies fear what will happen in the country when they leave.\n",
            "953: Some allies don’t share Biden’s perception of China as a military threat.\n",
            "954: Biden, at his own news conference, emphasized his support for NATO.\n",
            "955: Biden noted that the only time Article 5 had been invoked was after the September 11 terror attacks on the U.S. — a point Stoltenberg and European allies often reiterate.\n",
            "956: But some seem to worry that Biden will be too soft on the alliance — including Macron, who has pushed for better political cohesion among allies, and also demanded recognition of Europe’s broader efforts to develop so-called strategic autonomy, the push to build up capabilities on the Continent.\n",
            "957: The report said Biden should instead encourage European military integration, pushing allies to cooperate so they can do more to protect themselves, rather than just pressing them to spend more on their individual national forces, which creates waste and inefficiencies.\n",
            "958: While negotiations on the new body are still ongoing, U.S. President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen plan to announce details of the project when they meet in Brussels on June 15.\n",
            "959: Biden and his EU counterparts \"will focus on aligning our approaches to trade and technology so that democracies and not anyone else, not China or other autocracies, are writing the rules for trade and technology for the 21st century,\" Jake Sullivan, the White House's national security adviser, told reporters this week.\n",
            "960: In a round of phone calls with leaders in Brussels, U.S. President-elect Joe Biden spoke Monday with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel, who extended congratulations for his victory over Donald Trump.\n",

            "967: During their conversation, Michel specifically thanked Biden for joining with other U.S. officials, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in standing with Ireland to insist that the U.K. fully implement the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.\n",
            "968: Stoltenberg said he had also offered congratulations and told Biden he looked forward to planning the next NATO leaders’ summit in 2021.\n",
            "969: And with Joe Biden officially launching his re-election campaign last week, the U.S. president is now one step closer to facing voters within months of his EU counterpart, Ursula von der Leyen, who is still deciding whether to seek her own second term atop the European Commission.\n",
            "970: A defeated Biden could mean a return of Donald Trump, who as president launched a trade war with Europe, openly questioned multilateralism and cast the European Union as a foe.\n",
            "971: And a departing von der Leyen would deprive a re-elected Biden of a resolute EU ally on touchy subjects like sanctioning Russia and keeping China at bay.\n",
            "972: “We are fortunate to have European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President Biden where they are today,” Representative Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told POLITICO.\n",

            "974: The EU was still reeling from the roller-coaster Trump years and it seemed inevitable that things could only get better with the pro-EU Biden in the White House.\n",
            "975: “Part of that is down to the strong relationship between Biden and von der Leyen, which has allowed the sides to manage through any challenges in the relationship.”\n",
            "976: Part of this is due to a meeting of minds between von der Leyen, the 64-year-old former German defense minister, and Biden the 46th U.S. president, who was intimately acquainted with Ukraine policy following his stint as vice president during the Obama administration.\n",
            "977: At a critical Oval Office meeting in November of that year, Biden, who had just come from a briefing by national security and intelligence officials about the buildup of Russian battalions near the Ukraine border, sounded the alarm to von der Leyen.\n",
            "978: Similarly, a plan to remove Trump-era steel and aluminum tariffs on the EU still remains unresolved more than two years into the Biden presidency.\n",
            "979: But the biggest strain on relations was Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.\n",
            "980: Von der Leyen’s perceived closeness to Biden has ruffled some feathers.\n",
            "981: For Gardner, the former U.S. ambassador, it is von der Leyen’s position on China that is one of the closest indications of the strength of the relationship between the Biden administration and the European Commission.\n",
            "982: As the United States sounds the warning bell about Beijing’s geopolitical ambitions, particularly when it comes to Taiwan, Biden may discover he needs that supportive voice on China that von der Leyen offers.\n",
            "983: Given the resistance by some EU figures — not least Macron — to America’s world-view in Asia, Biden may need all the support he can get.\n",
            "984: That’s the simple rule for European power players looking for entrée to the new U.S. presidential administration should Joe Biden win the election on Tuesday.\n",

            "987: The two Tonys are emblematic of the resuscitation and return of the traditional U.S. foreign policy establishment that is expected if Biden becomes president.\n",
            "988: Blinken is much-discussed as likely to become Biden’s national security adviser.\n",
            "989: But beyond the return to normalcy, Biden will face a critical choice even before he is sworn into office: between Democrats who crave a resumption of the policies of former President Barack Obama and those who want to correct Obama’s missteps — including some glaring failures in Syria or on Russia relations — and to forge a new U.S. foreign policy doctrine for the 21st century.\n",
            "990: Where Biden stands will quickly be evident in how he builds his Cabinet and fills senior posts.\n",
            "991: Biden’s inner circle, led by Blinken, aged 58, is a generation younger than their boss, who will turn 78 next month.\n",
            "992: Blinken and McKeon worked for Biden for many years as top aides on the Senate foreign relations committee; Haines also briefly worked on the committee when Biden was chairman.\n",
            "993: Blinken, Sullivan, Carpenter, McKeon and Smith all worked in Biden’s vice presidential office.\n",
            "994: And Carpenter and McKeon have run the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement at the University of Pennsylvania, an institute created after Biden left office in 2017.\n",
            "995: Then there’s the larger foreign policy establishment, in which Biden has spent most of his career.\n",

            "997: A Biden victory in November would offer the temptation of seeking to restore the United States’ post–Cold War image of itself as a virtuous hegemon.\n",
            "998: There is no doubt Biden and his team would mark a return to more traditional foreign policy — renewed support for multilateral organizations and long-held alliances; less tweeting and courting of strongmen like Russian President Vladimir Putin or Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n",
            "999: “There’s a choice that the Biden folks are going to have to make,” said one member of the Blob, who has advised the campaign and spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing chances of a job.\n",
            "1000: “People don’t quite know — what is Biden trying to do?” the campaign adviser said.\n",
            "1001: While much attention has focused on a debate between progressive Democrats like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren and centrists like Biden, Wright focuses on a more nuanced split between the centrists, which Biden will have to referee.\n",
            "1002: Contenders for secretary of state include Senator Chris Coons, who currently holds Biden’s old seat from Delaware; Senator Chris Murphy, a relative young and progressive member of the foreign relations committee from Connecticut; Susan Rice, who served as ambassador to the U.N. and national security adviser for Obama; and Samantha Power, another former U.N. envoy.\n",
            "1003: Compared with Trump, who waged a war against the alleged “deep state” throughout his presidency, Biden will certainly put greater faith in all of his advisers, and especially in the U.S. foreign policy and intelligence communities.\n",

            "1286: Biden added that there was not a scenario in which the U.S. government could be prompted to send troops to rescue Americans trying to flee the country in the event of a Russian strike: “That’s a world war where Americans and Russian start shooting at one another.\n",
            "1287: Biden said the U.S. would not swoop to evacuate Americans in the event of an attack.\n",
            "1288: How do you even find them?” Biden said.\n",

            "1291: Although Biden hasn’t entered the race, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll Monday found that many people would support him if he did.\n",

            "1296: Biden didn’t mention the conversations he and his staff are having about building a strategy so that he’ll be best positioned to run if he decides to at the end of next year — or his longtime consultant Mike Donilon, who was perhaps most in favor of his running in 2016, who watched the speech from the side of the room.\n",
            "1297: “I don’t think Donald Trump can hear you!” New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley called out to the crowd, urging them to cheer more loudly for Biden as the event began.\n",

            "1299: It wasn’t the press’s fault, but they focused on all of that,” Biden said.\n",
            "1300: Biden mostly avoided talking directly about Trump, using his name only in passing asides, and referring to him at one section of his hour-long speech as “the new guy.” He said the Trump administration has been marked so far by “an assault on the things we value so deeply,” and pointing to a personal priority, said that the current administration hadn’t shown any interest in continuing his cancer moon-shot work, bringing together money and research to try to find a cure.\n",
            "1301: Democrats should be angry about Trump, Biden said, but they should be angry too about how much they’ve lost their way and what that’s meant for America.\n",

            "1304: “Scapegoating has become a national political obligation,” Biden said.\n",
            "1305: Contrast that, Biden said, to the events he did for Clinton during the campaign with white union members in the Midwest, when he got them applauding for same sex marriage, stopping violence against women, and immigration.\n",

            "1309: Those 172,000 people we needed, a lot of them wondered whether it’d been forgotten they’d been abused by the system,” Biden said, referring to the combined margin in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.\n",
            "1310: New Hampshire Democrats seemed ready for whatever Biden is going to do next, leaving the room after a roadshow of Biden classic stories, from stories he always tells about certain conversations with world leaders to the night his father told him about having to leave him with family for a while to go find work, to the super-fast turns from stage whispering to booming in the microphone.\n",
            "1311: U.S. President Joe Biden tried to cool a diplomatic blow-up with French President Emmanuel Macron Wednesday, conceding Washington should have consulted Paris over an Indo-Pacific security pact that enraged France.\n",

            "1314: Biden reaffirmed \"the strategic importance of French and European engagement in the Indo-Pacific region,\" including recognizing EU's strategy for the region, published on the day of the announcement of the new three-way security agreement, known as AUKUS.\n",
            "1315: Biden also recognized \"the importance of a stronger and more capable European defense\" — a key priority for Macron.\n",

            "1321: Hungary has hauled in the American ambassador for a dressing down after U.S. President Joe Biden’s remarks about Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán wanting to run a “dictatorship.”\n",
            "1322: During a presidential campaign stop in Pennsylvania on Friday,  Biden said that Orbán “doesn’t think democracy works and is looking for dictatorship,” after the Hungarian leader’s love-in with Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump in Florida last week.\n",
            "1323: The Biden administration has often been at odds with Orbán’s government, including over Hungary’s close ties to Russia.\n",
            "1324: Joe Biden's victory in the U.S. presidential election has been a win for transatlantic relations, but divisions over privacy may take longer to heal.\n",
            "1325: In the lead-up to the U.S. election, public officials, company executives, privacy advocates and outside legal experts told POLITICO that a Biden win may in fact hit the brakes on a EU-U.S. data deal, with changes to key personnel in Washington expected to slow negotiations while there would be little difference in the two administrations' stances on privacy and national security.\n",
            "1326: “It could take Biden around six months to have a new cabinet in place to sign off on the U.S.’s negotiating position,” the official said.\n",
            "1327: Additionally, national security law — which provides American agencies far-reaching means to collect data on non-U.S. citizens — is a rare area where few major differences exist between incoming Biden and outgoing Trump administrations.\n",
            "1328: “What would it look like if Biden moved heaven and earth to get something through and it fails when the ECJ says it’s not enough,” Hengesbaugh said.\n",

            "1333: Biden left Europe in a jubilant mood, fresh off essentially welcoming Sweden into the alliance and displaying transatlantic unity that is deeply personal to the president.\n",
            "1334: A day earlier, in the week’s centerpiece speech from the NATO summit in Lithuania, Biden defended his policies and rallied democracies to keep up the fight against tyranny in Ukraine and around the world.\n",
            "1335: And the problem for Biden is that much of what comes next isn’t wholly in his control.\n",
            "1336: What’s more, those long-term commitments to Ukraine — which Biden likens to America’s support for Israel — will require congressional lawmakers to commit to staying the course for years.\n",

            "1351: Biden said that he’s “deeply saddened and outraged by the incident,” adding “the U.S. will continue to support Israel.” He did not provide evidence for his remarks that the deadly explosion might have been caused by Palestinian militants.\n",
            "1352: “I’m looking forward to having a discussion about what happens from here,” Biden told Netanyahu.\n",

            "1354: Joe Biden managed to tread carefully around historic and current political sensitivities during the first part of his trip to the island of Ireland this week, marking 25 years since the U.S.-brokered Good Friday Agreement sought to secure lasting peace for Northern Ireland.\n",

            "1366: If that too rings a bell, it might be because Joe Biden, a young senator on the foreign relations committee in 1981, made exactly the same move in the opening months of his own presidency.\n",
            "1367: John McCain, the deceased American war hero and longtime Biden friend, liked to say that “history doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes.” The maxim (often attributed to Mark Twain) would serve as a good motto for Biden’s trip to Europe this week, where he’ll participate in an alphabet soup of summits, from the G7 to NATO.\n",

            "1375: Europe experienced a dramatic increase in China’s engagement with the region during the Trump years, culminating in the landmark investment agreement Beijing signed with the EU in late December, just weeks before Biden took office.\n",

            "1387: U.S. President Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw from the White House race may well turn 2024 into the Year of the Woman — namely, that of Vice President Kamala Harris who, armed with the outgoing president’s endorsement, can now be considered the front-runner to replace him atop the Democratic ticket.\n",
            "1388: But that was a choice made when Biden was still heading the Democratic ticket.\n",
            "1389: So, with a wounded Biden in the race, the VP pick made electoral sense: Vance’s personal journey from Rust Belt poverty — and the Appalachian origins of his dysfunctional hillbilly family — to academic and political stardom is compelling.\n",
            "1390: Last week, while pressure was mounting on Biden to quit the race, Trump was still trailing the ailing incumbent among women voters in Florida — and that says a lot in and of itself.\n",

            "1642: Flores said Biden’s second statement was better than the first, but “by him saying that never ever did he believe his behavior was inappropriate is still a big problem because it’s really hard for me to believe that after so many years of the same type of behavior and so many pictures and so many videos that someone didn’t at some point didn’t say to him, ‘You should stop behaving this way.’”\n",

            "1652: But at this mention of the equal rights amendment, somebody started to clap, and others followed suit, and the smattering of applause felt like an act of mercy — giving the characteristically discursive Biden a chance to reset and everybody else the opportunity to take a breath and maybe not think too hard about the fact that the former vice president had bungled by a decade the dates of two of the most jarring and consequential killings in modern American history.\n",

            "1660: It’s an issue because of things Biden has said and done — suggesting, for instance, he thought he was in Vermont when he actually was in New Hampshire, dropping that wince-worthy phrase that his “time is up” in the first debate and oddly invoking a record player in the last debate.\n",
            "1661: It’s an issue because Biden himself has tried in sometimes awkward ways to keep it from being one, inviting a heckler to run with him during a parade and challenging a reporter to a wrestling match.\n",
            "1662: And it’s an issue because opponents, from Trump (“Sleepy Joe”) to those in his own party trying to knock him off, have made it an issue — from Eric Swalwell sayingit was time to “pass the torch” to Tim Ryan saying he’s “declining” to Julian Castro (dubiously) accusing him of “forgetting” things to Cory Booker dishing out readymade Republican attack ad fodder by bluntly declaring on CNN that “there’s a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden’s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling” and “there are definitely moments where you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder.” Even the famously gracious Jimmy Carter, who just turned 95, delivered a candid if unhelpful assessment last month when he said he didn’t believe he could have handled “the duties that I experienced when I was president” if he had been 80.\n",

            "1665: All three of the top-polling Democrats, after all, are in their 70s, but it’s Biden, the centrist who advocates for a return to a pre-Trump time, who is getting dinged the most for his advanced age — not Elizabeth Warren, who wants “big, structural change” and turned 70 in June.\n",

            "1861: Not only will Biden lack a strong mandate if he wins by the skin of his teeth, but Congress looks likely to remain divided, with the Democrats controlling the House of Representatives and the Republicans in charge in the Senate.\n",
            "1862: The technical term for that constellation is “gridlock.” It will force Biden into the same corner that Trump faced for the past two years and that bedeviled much of Barack Obama’s time in office.\n",
            "1863: That’s why European leaders were hoping Biden would win by a landslide with the Democrats riding his coattails in Congress.\n",
            "1864: A strong Biden win could have allowed Washington and its European allies to pursue the kind of sweeping transatlantic agenda many think is essential in order to renew and redefine the alliance, especially in the face of the growing challenge posed by China.\n",
            "1865: At the back of Europe’s mind will also be the question of what happens four years from now, even if Biden wins this time.\n",
            "1866: Given his age, Biden could well choose to be a one-term president.\n",
            "1867: Yet that issue could remain a source of tension with a Biden administration, which, like Trump, is keen to focus more on China in the coming years.\n",
            "1868: A Biden administration would likely follow Trump’s policy of pushing Europe to take on more responsibility for its own security, albeit with a less aggressive tone.\n",

            "1874: Ukrainians hope they’ll benefit from Biden’s previous experience in Ukraine and his understanding that “defeating Russia also means defeating corruption in Ukraine,” according to Bonner.\n",
            "1875: Rather than widespread support for Biden, it might be more accurate to say that a majority in Ukraine are actively worried about Trump’s policies, said Volodymyr Fesenko, who heads the political consultancy company, Penta and previously advised the governments of former Presidents Petro Poroshenko and Viktor Yuschenko.\n",
            "1876: A victory for Biden, Ukrainians argue, would bring back a sense of normality to relations that have become increasingly unpredictable over the past four years.\n",

            "1880: The Continent’s leading websites splashed with scathing reactions and commentary about the showdown between Biden and former U.S. President Donald Trump, with many singling out Biden for criticism after a rocky display in which he struggled with detail and delivered halting lines.\n",
            "1881: Swedish broadcaster SVT declared Biden’s showing “near-catastrophic,” while Finland’s Yle called his performance a “disaster.” Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra said Biden acted “confused” with a “hoarse voice,” and Poland’s Onet declared that Trump “put [Biden] on his back,” calling it “sad to watch.”\n",
            "1882: France’s Le Monde called Biden’s stumbling over his words a “shipwreck,” adding that Trump “was able to roll out lies without contradiction,” while Britain’s Economist said Biden’s “horrific debate performance casts his entire candidacy into doubt.”\n",

            "1894: The question, now that Starmer is preparing to govern, is whether he will be able to keep making boring work — or whether, like Biden before him, it will come back to bite him.\n",

            "1898: “He promised ‘Infrastructure Week’ every week for four years and never built a damn thing,” Biden said this spring to a group of laughing union members while touting the launch of 50,000 projects due to one of the signature domestic spending laws he signed.\n",
            "1899: “Americans overwhelmingly chose President Biden’s competent leadership over Trump’s chaos and weakness,” said Charles Lutvak, campaign spokesman, speaking before the U.S. president’s disastrous debate performance kicked off another round of concerns about Biden’s age, leading to calls he should step down to make way for another candidate.\n",
            "1900: Even before Biden became interesting for all the wrong reasons, his poll numbers were already slipping, with surveys predicting a defeat in November against a politician whose ability to dominate a news cycle — good or bad — is unparalleled in modern American history.\n",
            "1901: “We wanted to let tired Americans think about the White House less,” said one former senior Biden campaign official not authorized to speak publicly about internal conversations.\n",
            "1902: Recently, White House and campaign advisers have grown frustrated with how difficult it has been to take their message — of Biden being the competent adult in the room — and break through the cluttered, fractured media landscape, according to three officials not authorized to publicly discuss internal conversations.\n",
            "1903: Part of the problem has been the messenger himself: Biden, like Starmer, isn’t the most dynamic communicator.\n",

            "1909: Coons’ stance, articulated for the first time during an interview with POLITICO, could prove a headache for Biden.\n",
            "1910: “There are conditions on our aid,” he said, alluding to the numerous laws and policies surrounding arms transfers, including a Biden administration directive restricting transfers to foreign countries when it is more likely than not that it would lead to a serious violation of human rights or humanitarian law.\n",
            "1911: Israel insists it’s about to turn toward a less intense, more targeted phase of military operations — a shift the Biden administration hopes will save lives in Gaza and alleviate suffering for the enclave’s 2.3 million people.\n",

            "1916: Vice President Joe Biden several times criticized what he called an Israeli government that causes “overwhelming frustration” in a speech that seemed to rule out the chances of a final year peace push from the Obama administration.\n",
            "1917: “The present course Israel’s on is not one that’s likely to secure its existence as a Jewish, democratic state— and we have to make sure that happens,” Biden said, in a speech to the annual gala dinner of the left-leaning J Street held in Washington.\n",
            "1918: But Monday, Biden went harder at Netanyahu as he sketched out a reality he said that’s left him feeling that “the path for peace is shrouded.”\n",
            "1919: “There is, at the moment, no political will among Israelis and Palestinians to move forward with serious negotiations,” Biden said.\n",
            "1920: Biden kicked off his remarks by praising Stav Shaffir, a 30-year-old member of the Israeli Knesset from the left whom he said was a “flashback” to his own election to the Senate at the age of 29.\n",
            "1921: “May your views once again begin to have a majority opinion in the Knesset,” Biden said.\n",
            "1922: Biden said his trip to the Middle East last month, when he met with both Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, had left him with a sense of pessimism.\n",
            "1923: Biden said his meetings with the two leaders did not leave him “feeling encouraged about the prospects of peace.”\n",
            "1924: Speaking ahead of Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry expressed more optimism, saying his efforts continue, but stressing the need for a two-state solution, and quickly: “Anything else will not be Jewish, and will not be democratic,” he said.\n",
            "1925: Whatever happens, Biden said, the United States has a vital role to play, and organizations like J Street, which “proves there’s no contradiction between being progressive and pro-Israeli,” are at the forefront.\n",
            "1926: “We are Israel’s maybe not-only friend,” Biden said, “but only absolutely certain friend.”\n",
            "1927: But Joseph Biden’s firm public commitment that he would select a woman as his running mate in the event he stays atop the Democratic race and is the party’s 2020 nominee is historically unprecedented: No major candidate has ever made such a pledge based on demographic characteristics, nor has one narrowed the field of potential vice presidential nominees this early in the year, several months before the decision is usually made.\n",
            "1928: Bernie Sanders, the only other candidate still competing in an election cycle in which debate stages once had to accommodate as many as 20 candidates over two nights, matched Biden’s hard pledge with a soft one, saying that “in all likelihood” he would also name a women as long as she shares his progressive views and that “my very strong tendency to move in that direction.”\n",
            "1929: The moment showed Biden signaling that his thoughts are already far advanced into the politics of the general election.\n",
            "1930: In giving up a measure of latitude about his choice, Biden also seemed to be suggesting something about how he views himself and how he wants other Democrats to view him: Not necessarily as the most commanding figure or someone clinging to personal prerogatives, but the sturdiest vessel to accommodate the party’s disparate demographic and ideological blocs.\n",
            "1931: Sturdy, in fact, seemed to be the motif for Biden’s two-hour performance, held without an audience at CNN’s Washington studio.\n",
            "1932: The last time Biden was on a debate stage was two weeks ago, in South Carolina.\n",
            "1933: History has pivoted in those two weeks, both for Biden and the country.\n",
            "1934: That pivot imposed some new questions on Biden and Sanders both as they entered the debate.\n",
            "1935: Even so, Biden opened the evening with a sober tone and factual recitation of measures he wants to fight the pandemic, including expanded testing via drive-through locations in every state, enlisting the military to help expand the pool of hospital beds, and quick action on spending to help people who have lost jobs and to offset the deadening effect on the economy.\n",
            "1936: Biden appeared more relaxed in a two-person contest, compared to earlier debates when he often receded in the noise or gave answers that bordered on unintelligible.\n",
            "1937: Biden was plainly eager to propitiate progressives, offering words of praise for departed candidate Elizabeth Warren and noting that he had spoken with her this week in support of her effort to modify a bankruptcy law that Biden helped pass in 2005.\n",
            "1938: Biden’s pledge to pick a woman as running mate, though plainly planned and not spontaneous, came during a rebuttal to Sanders, who said he intended a cabinet that “will look like America,” and boasted of his superior record on abortion rights and affordable childcare for working women.\n",
            "1939: Biden said in reply that he intended to name a black woman to the Supreme Court, as well as a woman to be his vice president: “There are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow.”\n",
            "1940: Biden repeated and at times intensified his frequent criticism of Sanders’ plans for such things as mandatory Medicare for All as too expensive and unworkable.\n",
            "1941: The Vermont senator came eager to debate his ideological arguments—especially on curbing corporate power, expanding health care, and mobilizing to fight climate change—and said he worries that Biden would have problems mobilizing young people in a general election against President Donald Trump.\n",
            "1942: But he did not try to light up Biden in sharply personal ways, in the fashion that Warren did successfully against former candidate Michael Bloomberg in the two previous debates.\n",
            "1943: Instead, Sanders portrayed Biden as well-intentioned but timid.\n",
            "1944: On climate change, for instance, he told Biden: “I know your heart is in the right place, but this requires dramatic, bold action.\n",
            "1945: This is hardly the kind of language that is impossible to walk back, or that gets in the way of an eventual endorsement, which Sanders says he will give to Biden if his own comeback plans don’t materialize.\n",
            "1946: Sanders peevishly needled Biden for a decade ago backing the Bowles-Simpson budget commission, which contemplated curbing the growth in spending for Social Security, Medicare, and veterans benefits.\n",
            "1947: Biden denied backing the commission, or any plans to cut popular entitlements.\n",
            "1948: That may well suit Biden just fine.\n",
            "1949: There was nothing over two hours of debate that seemed to fundamentally change the trajectory of the race, and that trajectory right now is favoring Biden.\n",
            "1950: London hopes to distinguish itself from Brussels, whose new investment deal with Beijing has gone down badly with the Biden team.\n",
            "1951: LONDON — In the race to be Joe Biden’s best friend in Europe, the U.K. has a plan — to be different on China.\n",
            "1952: While Wednesday’s inauguration of the 46th president of the United States will spell the end of Donald Trump’s blame-China-for-everything approach, early signals from Joe Biden’s transition team are that Washington will not be going soft on Beijing — and doesn’t want allies to either.\n",
            "1953: Officials in Boris Johnson’s government hope their mixture of toughness and foreign policy pragmatism will rhyme with Biden's — and set them apart from Brussels, Berlin and Paris.\n",
            "1954: Even so, U.K. officials say their approach stands in contrast to the EU, which, as the U.K.’s former national security adviser Mark Sedwill noted in an article in the Daily Mail on the eve of Biden’s inauguration, \"rushed through\" a new investment deal with China days before the new president takes office.\n",
            "1955: The deal went ahead despite Biden's incoming National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan requesting that the EU take the U.S.'s \"common concerns\" into account — something Biden's team are \"deeply unhappy about,\" according to Sedwill.\n",
            "1956: While Biden’s opposition to Brexit and previous critical comments about Boris Johnson have been much-discussed as reasons why the “special relationship” might suffer, U.K. officials have been at pains to point out how — on many matters of substance — London is much more in tune with Biden than it ever was with Trump.\n",
            "1957: Climate change, the promotion of democratic values and the U.K.’s willingness to back up good diplomatic intentions with defense spending are all areas that U.K. diplomats have highlighted to counterparts in Biden’s team, officials said.\n",
            "1958: U.K. officials are pitching the country as a partner for Biden in helping to build those international alliances.\n",
            "1959: With Biden’s foreign policy agenda emphasizing the strengthening of democratic alliances after an era of Trumpist unilateralism, the U.K. also has two major international events in 2021 to ram home its usefulness as a convenor of like-minded nations, hosting both the G7 summit in June and COP26 U.N. climate change meeting in November.\n",
            "1960: The U.K.'s stated priorities for the meeting had Biden’s foreign policy goals plainly in sight, said Sophia Gaston, director of the London-based British Foreign Policy Group think tank.\n",
            "1961: Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is not expected to visit Washington until the coronavirus situation allows, with expectations that Biden’s team will make a point of permitting only absolutely essential diplomatic exchanges while virus cases remain high.\n",
            "1962: For the EU, Joe Biden’s first overseas trip as U.S. president was like having big brother come home from university — just in time to confront the neighborhood bully.\n",
            "1963: After four days at busy leaders’ summits of the G7 and NATO, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel finally got a chance to sit down with Biden on Tuesday for their own quiet conversation about EU-U.S. relations, before sending him off to Geneva where he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n",
            "1964: The meeting on Tuesday was nothing short of a lovefest, with perhaps the only disagreement being who was happiest, Biden or the Europeans, that Donald Trump is no longer president of the United States.\n",
            "1965: “Well, Mr. President, dear Joe, we are so pleased to welcome you in Brussels,” von der Leyen said, as she joined Michel to greet Biden on the red carpet of the Council’s Europa building.\n",
            "1966: Biden quickly picked up the theme.\n",
            "1967: As a down payment on rejuvenated relations, Biden agreed to a truce in the nastiest, longest-running cross-Atlantic trade feud — the battle over state subsidies to the airplane manufacturers Airbus and Boeing.\n",
            "1968: The EU side did acknowledge that it was time for Biden and the U.S. to get more serious about carbon pricing, as part of the global response to climate change.\n",
            "1969: That Biden did not even bother to stick around for the closing news conference was also quickly forgiven.\n",
            "1970: On trade, she said it was good Biden had dropped Trump’s pretense for tariffs.\n",
            "1971: But she was even happier about Biden’s views on the transatlantic relationship.\n",
            "1972: “It was impressive to see and to listen to President Biden how clearly he, first of all, was acknowledging that yes, we know that the last four years were difficult and the world has changed, but Europe has also changed,” von der Leyen said.\n",
            "1973: A first test of how well they will do on the stability and security front will be Biden’s high-stakes meeting in Geneva, where the Europeans are counting on him to try to at least set the stage for a breakthrough with Putin.\n",
            "1974: But the Europeans must also consider how dismal ties are between Moscow and Washington and how big a hole Biden and Putin need to climb out of after years of ill-will.\n",
            "1975: Samuel Charap, senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, said that the Biden-Putin confrontation might be regarded as successful if they could agree on such minor steps as restoring normal diplomatic relations, with ambassadors back in each other’s capitals.\n",
            "1976: Von der Leyen said Europe hoped to join forces with Biden so there is “clear pushback on breaches of international law; clear pushback on breaches of human rights” and “secondly, to constrain Russia’s attempts to undermine us.”\n",
            "1977: “But,” she said, “the EU-Russia relationship is on a negative spiral and this is what we conveyed clearly to President Biden.”\n",
            "1978: LONDON — Joe Biden’s arrival in the White House will push the U.K. to work more closely with the EU — but won’t be the thing that clinches a Brexit deal.\n",
            "1979: Biden becomes U.S. president-elect at a critical moment in Brexit talks, as negotiators enter the final weeks where agreement is possible if the U.K. is going to leave the transition period at the end of the year with a trade deal in place.\n",
            "1980: Biden has long opposed Brexit and his Irish roots have sparked hopes in Ireland that he would take the Republic’s side in any cross-border Brexit dispute.\n",
            "1981: \"The bottom line is that Brexit is an act of self-isolation,\" Charles Kupchan, a former President Barack Obama official and now Biden adviser, told Times Radio on Sunday.\n",
            "1982: \"Now that Joe Biden is going to be the next president of the United States, that will be a cause for, certainly, a pause for thought in No. 10, to ensure that Irish issues are prioritized as we try to close out this phase of the Brexit negotiation,\" Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told RTÉ radio Monday.\n",
            "1983: \"The statements that have come — not only from Joe Biden but from many on Capitol Hill — that if the Good Friday Agreement and peace on the island of Ireland isn’t protected through Brexit, that securing a trade deal between the U.S. and U.K. would be very, very problematic.\"\n",
            "1984: However, Sophia Gaston, director of the British Foreign Policy Group, said the impact of Biden’s victory on the Brexit negotiations will be “minimal.”\n",
            "1985: Even if there is a no-deal Brexit and the British government takes steps that breach the Good Friday Agreement, Ruparel argues, its breaching would be such a massive issue for British politics that what Biden does in retaliation or whether he holds a U.K.-U.S. trade deal to ransom “would be entirely irrelevant.”\n",
            "1986: But many analysts and former diplomats expect a Biden presidency will strengthen links with Germany and France.\n",
            "1987: “We know that one of Biden’s core priorities will be to repair, to restore and to reinvigorate transatlantic relations, and by that he means Washington’s relationships with Brussels,” she said.\n",
            "1988: In some ways a Biden victory de-emphasizes the singular importance of the special relationship somewhat because the Biden team will be looking at transatlantic relations in the round.”\n",
            "1989: “When Biden looks towards Europe, he will see Paris and Berlin more as the center of gravity of what’s really important for America in Europe,” he said.\n",
            "1990: Nigel Farage, founder of the Brexit Party and a vocal supporter of Trump, agreed the U.K.’s influence in Washington would diminish under Biden.\n",
            "1991: “Donald Trump is pro-British in a way that Joe Biden never was and will never be,” he said.\n",
            "1992: “A Biden victory means a return to the days of Barack Obama, when he flew to Berlin when he crossed the Atlantic rather than to London.”\n",

            "2269: Kennedy, another Irish Catholic president, Biden grew up in a working-class family that struggled to make ends meet.\n",
            "2270: During a presidential debate with Donald Trump last year, Biden, who accused his opponent of being a racist, said people like him “look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics and like me and people who don’t have money.”\n",
            "2271: Just how personal Biden’s Irish connection is to him became clear during a visit he took with his family to County Mayo in western Ireland in 2016.\n",
            "2272: The other corner of Europe where the professional and political have melded for Biden is the former Yugoslavia, a region rife with historical divisions not dissimilar to those of Ireland.\n",
            "2273: The embargo was never lifted, mainly due to European resistance, but as the Srebrenica genocide and other horrors of the war would later illustrate, Biden and other critics were right.\n",
            "2274: Biden never gave up on the Balkans, returning time and again, long after most western politicians had lost interest.\n",
            "2275: After becoming vice president in 2009, Biden visited the region again, in part because he worried that Washington had all but forgotten about it after 9/11.\n",
            "2276: In 2016, Biden visited Kosovo for the opening of a new highway named after his late son, Beau, a lawyer who had worked to help establish a new justice system in the country in the early 2000s.\n",
            "2277: “Beau loved this country like I do,” Biden said of his son, who died of brain cancer in 2015.\n",
            "2278: As a convinced transatlanticist, Biden is nowhere more at home than in the wheelhouse of the western alliance — NATO headquarters.\n",
            "2279: Unlike his predecessor, who complained about the cost of NATO’s new modern complex and declared the alliance “obsolete,” Biden will celebrate the partnership as one of the greatest achievements of modern history.\n",
            "2280: Biden has been a fixture at NATO ever since he entered public service.\n",
            "2281: When the Senate approved NATO enlargement in 1998, Biden called it “the beginning of another 50 years of peace.”\n",
            "2282: For Biden, NATO is more than just an alliance; it represents the power of American ideals and what many of his generation still regard as the U.S.’s historic mission to spread freedom and democracy across the world.\n",
            "2283: Biden’s connection to the Bavarian capital has less to do with its famous beer halls than with the annual security conference there, which some lovingly call “Davos with guns.”\n",
            "2284: Biden became a regular at the annual meeting during the Cold War when it was still known by its German name: Wehrkunde.\n",
            "2285: During the Cold War, Biden would join other leading lights of the western alliance in the basement Stube of the five-star hotel that hosts the meeting to talk shop over beers and plot against the Soviets.\n",
            "2286: Biden never stopped coming.\n",
            "2287: In a speech at the meeting in 2019, now known as the Munich Security Conference, Biden upstaged then-Vice President Mike Pence, who was also there, exclaiming, “I promise you … We’ll be back.” Biden’s message to Europe: Trump won’t be around much longer.\n",
            "2288: Biden’s decision to spend his honeymoon on Hungary’s famous Lake Balaton wouldn’t be that notable if it weren’t for the year he did so: 1977.\n",
            "2289: That didn’t dissuade Biden, then still in his first term as a senator, from taking his bride behind the Iron Curtain.\n",
            "2290: It was Biden’s first trip to the region, and in addition to taking in the beauty of Balaton, he also spent time in Budapest, meeting with communist officials, journalists and dissidents.\n",
            "2291: The trip, which was organized by Tom Lantos, a Hungarian-born Holocaust survivor who worked as an adviser to Biden before becoming a U.S. congressman, left a strong impression on the future president.\n",
            "2292: Biden won a place in Hungary’s heart that year by promising that the U.S. would return the Hungarian crown, which the country had discovered in Austria in 1945.\n",
            "2293: Those good memories notwithstanding, Biden is unlikely to return to Hungary anytime soon.\n",
            "2294: When United States President Joe Biden decided to travel to Israel this week, his immediate objective was to express solidarity with Israel, to avoid escalating the war beyond Gaza and to ask tough questions about the strategy Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war Cabinet were pursuing.\n",
            "2295: Jordan’s King Abdullah II, who had previously warned the Middle East was “on the brink of falling into the abyss,” canceled a summit with Biden in Amman that was scheduled for Thursday, declaring a three-day period of mourning.\n",
            "2296: Though Biden understandably hesitated about whether to set off to Israel after the sudden turnaround, he decided to go through with the trip, hoping to make the best of a rapidly deteriorating situation.\n",
            "2297: Promising to submit an “unprecedented support package” for Israel to the U.S. Congress by the end of the week, Biden doubled down on his support for the Jewish state while also using the visit to emphasize his determination to prevent the conflict from escalating.\n",
            "2298: Biden also pressed Netanyahu’s government to let humanitarian supplies into Gaza immediately, which it reluctantly agreed to do — provided none of it went to Hamas.\n",
            "2299: Biden wasn’t about to tell Israel what to do.\n",
            "2300: Additionally, achieving rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which was already a Biden priority, is now more urgent than ever.\n",
            "2301: Joe Biden signaled a possible new direction for U.S. policy toward Syria in remarks in Turkey on Saturday, where the vice president was meeting with Turkish leaders to discuss the bloody civil war next door.\n",
            "2302: Biden was speaking at Istanbul’s Dolmabahçe Palace, where he held meetings with Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n",
            "2303: But Biden also went beyond past Obama administration statements and suggested the U.S. would be willing to use military means if necessary.\n",
            "2304: The National Security Council declined to say whether Biden’s remarks signaled a shift in U.S. strategy.\n",
            "2305: Biden reassured Turkey, which is dealing with a flare-up in its long-running conflict with Kurdish separatist groups led by the PKK.\n",
            "2306: The PKK, Biden said, “is a terrorist group plain and simple” — one he said has defied the Turkish government efforts to make peace.\n",
            "2307: Until that changes, “you must do what you need to protect your people,” Biden said.\n",
            "2308: Biden, pointedly, did not mention the YPG in his own list of terrorist groups.\n",
            "2309: Biden’s remarks come days ahead of long-anticipated Syria peace talks, which have been in limbo amid a bitter feud between the Middle East’s longtime rivals: Iran and Saudi Arabia.\n",
            "2310: The National Security Council declined to say whether Biden’s remarks signaled a shift in U.S. strategy, and directed questions to the vice president’s office.\n",
            "2311: LOS ANGELES — Joe Biden steamrolled across the South on Tuesday, carried Texas and won a stunning victory in Minnesota, severely weakening Bernie Sanders and recasting the race as a head-to-head contest between them.\n",
            "2312: But momentum was on Biden’s side.\n",
            "2313: Early, quick calls for Biden in the Virginia, North Carolina and Alabama primaries offered the first sign that the former vice president had won over much of an unsettled electorate’s late-breaking vote.\n",
            "2314: Addressing cheering supporters in California before polls here closed, Biden said, “It’s still early, but things are looking awful, awful good.”\n",
            "2315: Instead, Biden surpassed him.\n",
            "2316: Sanders, speaking at his rally in Burlington, Vt., on Tuesday night, predicted the night would end well for him despite Biden’s string of wins.\n",
            "2317: The early results appeared likely to narrow the race to Sanders and Biden, with the rest of the field barely hanging on.\n",
            "2318: Biden won Elizabeth Warren’s home state, Massachusetts, and Mike Bloomberg was teetering elsewhere.\n",
            "2319: After skipping the first four nominating states but spending hundreds of millions on TV ads, Bloomberg received disappointing news in the quick calls for Biden in Virginia and North Carolina.\n",
            "2320: Most likely, the set of elections, in which about one-third of delegates will be awarded, will culminate in a grouping of Democratic voters around opposite poles — progressives to Sanders and moderates to Biden.\n",
            "2321: But because of late balloting, the results from California could take days or weeks to count — and even small margins in that state could be significant to Biden, Bloomberg and Warren.\n",
            "2322: If Tuesday was a measure of Sanders’ durability, it also confirmed the extent of Biden’s momentum.\n",
            "2323: Biden said Monday that his campaign has raised more than $30 million since the beginning of last month, as he attempts to catch up to Sanders.\n",
            "2324: Rejecting criticism from fellow moderates that he could help Sanders by leaching support from Biden, Bloomberg said Tuesday, “I’m not helping Bernie Sanders.\n",
            "2325: DUBLIN — U.S. President Joe Biden often proclaims a sentimental soft spot for Ireland.\n",
            "2326: While Donald Trump rejected the OECD effort, Biden and his treasury chief, Janet Yellen, support it and, as part of any deal, want American multinationals to pay 21 percent on their profits overseas.\n"

            "1: President Biden served 36 years as a senator from Delaware, the most corporate-friendly state in the nation.\n",
            "2: As one observer noted, Biden was a neoliberal who became an economic nationalist because he apparently came to the conclusion that markets were broken, that power was too concentrated and workers were disempowered.\n",
            "3: But now the torch has been passed, so will Vice President Harris follow President Biden’s lead?\n",
            "4: The Biden-Harris administration’s frustration has been palpable.\n",
            "5: Yet polling seems to suggest that Harris is not being blamed or credited (yet) for the Biden economic record.\n",
            "6: To pay for this, Harris has adopted some and tweaked other parts of President Biden’s latest budget, which calls for new taxes on the wealthy and corporations but would keep the pledge that no one making under $400,000 a year would see a tax increase.\n",
            "7: WASHINGTON — A key question is looming for Vice President Kamala Harris as she edges closer to gaining the Democratic presidential nomination: Can she turn the Biden-Harris economic record into a political advantage in a way that President Joe Biden failed to do?\n",
            "8: In some ways, her task would seem straightforward: The administration oversaw a vigorous rebound from the pandemic recession, one that shrank the U.S. unemployment rate to a half-century low of 3.4% in early 2023 — far below the painful 6.4% rate when Biden and Harris took office in 2021.\n",
            "9: JD Vance of Ohio, has attacked Biden over the surge in housing costs, which has diminished the hopes of many would-be homebuyers.\n",
            "10: Speaking this week in Indianapolis, Harris highlighted her support for “affordable health care” and “affordable child care.” She also charged that Trump would eliminate the Biden administration's price cap on insulin, which the White House often cites as an example of its efforts to reduce high drug costs.\n",
            "11: Grocery prices are up 21% since Biden and Harris took office.\n",
            "12: A pound of ground beef has jumped $1.05 since Biden’s inauguration, to a national average of $5.36 a pound, according to government data.\n",
            "13: Economists at the Biden administration have calculated, though, that average wages have risen enough to make up for the higher costs.\n",
            "14: Economists at Motio Research have calculated that since Biden was inaugurated in January 2021, inflation-adjusted median household incomes have risen just 1.6% to $79,000.\n",
            "15: Government overspending, an activity the Biden administration has taken to a new level, has sent the country into an inflationary spiral.\n",
            "16: Rather than reversing course, President Joe Biden is telling voters the private sector is to blame and that he has the answers.\n",
            "17: But that hasn't stopped Biden from blaming energy companies — the same companies that reduced prices to record lows in relatively freer markets during the Trump administration.\n",
            "18: Don't forget about renters, who, like homebuyers, are no better off now than they were before Biden's activist regulatory spree took hold.\n",
            "19: Once again, however, the Biden administration found a convenient and private-sector scapegoat.\n",
            "20: President Joe Biden's letter announcing that he is standing down from the general election documented all the reasons the incumbent had to go.\n",
            "21: Biden should have announced he was not running for reelection a year ago — or, at the very least, before he blew the June 27 debate with Donald Trump.\n",
            "22: Now that he has announced he is not running for reelection, Biden nonetheless apparently plans to stay in office.\n",
            "23: Biden's actions have shown the world that he himself is every bad thing he has said about his 78-year-old Republican rival — unwilling to let go of power, uninterested in putting the country first and not even remotely up to the job.\n",
            "24: Biden, who had tested positive for COVID in Las Vegas, seemed unaware of recent polls that showed Trump ahead, often beyond the margin of error.\n",
            "25: That was the big moment in Joe Biden's demise.”\n",
            "26: In his letter, Biden gave a nod to Kamala Harris, 59.\n",
            "27: When Biden chose the then-California U.S. senator, he made no secret of the fact that the former San Franciscan's race and gender were prime reasons behind his choice.\n",
            "28: There's no way Biden can abandon her now.\n",
            "29: In 2020, party leaders and primary voters decided that Biden was the only Democrat who could beat Trump.\n",
            "30: And then Biden became the guest who wouldn't leave.\n",
            "31: Having invalidated the votes of more than 14 million Americans who selected Joe Biden to be the Democrat nominee for president, the self-proclaimed 'party of democracy' has proven exactly the opposite.”\n",
            "32: WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is meeting Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the White House on Thursday as the three nations use their first-ever trilateral summit to try to show they are in lockstep about countering China's military assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific.\n",
            "33: The U.S. Coast Guard will also welcome Filipino and Japanese coast guard members onto a U.S. Coast Guard vessel during the patrol for training, according to senior Biden administration officials who insisted on anonymity to preview the talks.\n",
            "34: The summit comes a day after Biden held one-on-one talks with Kishida and feted the Japanese premier with a glitzy state dinner at the White House, a diplomatic honor meant to recognize Tokyo's growing clout on the global stage.\n",
            "35: Biden also was hosting Marcos for a private meeting at the White House ahead of the scheduled three-way talks.\n",
            "36: Biden on Wednesday reflected on the fact that Japan, once a fierce U.S. enemy, has become one of the closest American partners and an indispensable ally in a shared push for peace, security and prosperity in the Pacific and beyond.\n",
            "37: “Just a few generations ago, our two nations were locked in a devastating conflict,” Biden said with Kishida by his side for a pomp-filled arrival ceremony at the White House.\n",
            "38: Biden, in a wide-ranging phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, raised concerns about China’s operations in the South China Sea, including efforts to impede the Philippines, which the U.S. is treaty-obligated to defend, from resupplying its forces on the Second Thomas Shoal.\n",
            "39: Biden has made improving relations with the Philippines a priority since Marcos became the country's president in June 2022.\n",
            "40: Biden hosted him for talks at the White House last year, the first Washington visit by a Philippine president in more than a decade.\n",
            "41: Biden also met him on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly soon after Marcos took office, and dispatched Vice President Kamala Harris to Manila in 2022 to meet him.\n",
            "42: President Joe Biden, late last month, received a booster shot of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
            "43: One Instagram post showed Biden receiving the shot with the caption, \"Fake president, in a fake White House, receiving fake booster.\"\n",
            "44: It was where five days earlier Biden participated in a global coronavirus summit.\n",
            "45: Other social media posts claimed it was a \"body double,\" not Biden, who received the vaccine booster, asking, \"Can you explain where the tattoo is?\"\n",
            "46: The post showed Biden receiving the shot in his left arm, free from any tattoos, and an image of the shirtless person, purportedly Biden with a prominent tattoo on his left arm, washing a car outside the White House.\n",
            "47: One of these images is fake, according to Reuters, but it's not the photo of Biden getting the shot.\n",
            "48: It was used with a fake story that said Biden was washing his 1981 Trans Am and included the fake quote, \"Gotta get her looking good so I can impress the chicks when I'm cruising down Pennsylvania (Avenue).\"\n",
            "49: WASHINGTON — Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning.\n",
            "50: The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs.\n",

            "52: On Saturday, a fifth Democratic lawmaker said openly that Biden should not run again.\n",
            "53: Angie Craig of Minnesota said that after what she saw and heard in the debate with Republican rival Donald Trump, and Biden’s “lack of a forceful response” afterward, he should step aside “and allow for a new generation of leaders to step forward.”\n",
            "54: Craig posted one of the Democrats’ key suburban wins in the 2018 midterms and could be a barometer for districts that were vital for Biden in 2020.\n",
            "55: But it is bound to drag on until Biden steps aside or Democrats realize he won’t and learn to contain their concerns about the president’s chances against Trump.\n",

            "63: As Biden’s camp encourages House lawmakers to give the president the chance to show what he can do, one Democratic aide said the Friday interview didn't help and in fact made things worse.\n",

            "93: In the seven days that have passed since the June 27 presidential debate between Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, the Biden campaign has faced an onslaught of concerns and complaints, with calls from fellow Democrats for him to drop out, donors angry that he is not doing more to reassure voters, and advisers trying to rally behind him.\n",
            "94: Biden and his team, recognizing that they face a narrow window to steady the situation and prevent further defections within an already anxious Democratic Party, scrambled to stage an afternoon rally in a key swing state and agreed to an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that will air in prime time Friday.\n",

            "569: I know we can,\" Biden said in the video, repeating a mantra he said a dozen times during his State of the Union address in February, listing everything from passing a ban on assault-style weapons and lowering the cost of prescription drugs to codifying a national right to abortion after the Supreme Court's ruling last year overturning Roe v.\n",
            "570: Buoyed by the midterm results, Biden plans to continue to cast all Republicans as embracing what he calls \"ultra-MAGA\" politics - a reference to Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan - regardless of whether his predecessor ends up on the 2024 ballot.\n",

            "576: Still, many Democrats would prefer that Biden didn't run again.\n",

            "580: And they insist that when Biden is compared with whomever the GOP nominates, Democrats and independents will rally around Biden.\n",
            "581: To prevail again, Biden will need the alliance of young voters and Black voters - particularly women - along with blue-collar Midwesterners, moderates and disaffected Republicans who helped him win in 2020.\n",

            "605: “There will always be forces that pull our countries apart,” Biden said, rejecting “a desire to retreat from the world and go it alone.” He said, \"Our task, our test, is to make sure that the forces holding us together are stronger than the forces pulling us apart.”\n",

            "648: The Biden administration’s proposed regulation, published in April 2023, took a nuanced approach.\n",
            "649: Nonetheless, issuing such a rule risks injecting the issue into an election year in which President Biden faces a close contest with former President Donald Trump, who has promised to ban trans women from women’s sports if reelected.\n",
            "650: “Folks close to Biden have made the political decision to not move on the athletics [regulation] preelection,” said one person familiar with the administration’s thinking.\n",

            "653: But while he favors finalizing the rules quickly, others said the Biden strategy makes sense politically.\n",
            "654: As a candidate in 2020, President Biden signaled he would replace the regulation, and early in his term, he directed the Education Department to begin the laborious process of reviewing and ultimately writing a new set of rules.\n",

            "660: “Every single police department should have the money it needs to institute real reforms like adopting a national use of force standard, buying body cameras and recruiting more diverse police officers,” Biden wrote in an op-ed column published by USA Today in June.\n",
            "661: While many of his current proposals align with the agendas of reform advocates, Biden has been sharply criticized for his central role in the passage of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act in 1994.\n",
            "662: During last week's second and final debate, Biden called the act “a mistake.”\n",
            "663: Biden has earned praise for co-sponsoring the 1994 Violence Against Women Act, which provides funding for victim services, prevents use of past sexual behavior against complainants in a rape case, makes state protective orders enforceable nationwide, provides legal aid for survivors of domestic violence and created the Office on Violence Against Women within the Department of Justice.\n",
            "664: The truth is, whether former President Donald Trump had been found innocent and President Joe Biden’s son Hunter guilty, or Hunter innocent and Trump guilty, or both innocent, the system would still deserve our faith.\n",
            "665: We suspect that Hunter Biden’s conviction on three felonies on Tuesday won’t convince the most die-hard Trump supporters that Trump’s recent trial wasn’t “rigged,” and a “sham” as he has said — and that the trial wasn’t led by a “conflicted” and “corrupt” judge.\n",
            "666: But Biden’s trial and swift conviction on the three federal charges — all tied to his 2018 purchase of a gun — clearly has taken some wind out of the sails of the far-right narrative that Democrats have “weaponized” the American justice system for their own benefit.\n",
            "667: After all, the argument goes, if the Democrats controlled the system, then isn’t it likely that neither Hunter Biden nor New Jersey Sen.\n",
            "668: These last few weeks, it has been discouraging to see how supporters of Donald Trump and Hunter Biden, or anyone overly political, are unable to divorce their politics from how the trial court system works in this country.\n",
            "669: Given the deeply honed mistrust of the American justice system these days, including the claim that the Biden Administration and Justice Department are making a political persecution of Trump, it feels a little bit like a miracle when 12 ordinary men and women emerge from deliberation with a unanimous verdict.\n",
            "670: The president’s son, Hunter Biden: Guilty of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on a federal firearm application and possession of an illegally obtained gun.\n",

            "672: People close to Trump and Hunter Biden are no doubt disappointed by how the juries saw the evidence in their cases.\n",
            "673: WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he strongly supports a proposal from House Speaker Mike Johnson to provide aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\n",
            "674: Shortly after Johnson released the funding proposals, Democrat Biden offered his support for the package.\n",

            "676: WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden has made some strong claims over the past few days about shutting down the U.S.-Mexico border as he tries to salvage a border deal in Congress that would also unlock money for Ukraine.\n",

            "680: As the talks have progressed, Biden has come to embrace efforts to reach a bipartisan border security deal after years of gridlock on overhauling the immigration system.\n",
            "681: Biden is referencing an expulsion authority being negotiated by the lawmakers that would automatically kick in on days when illegal crossings reached more than 5,000 over a five-day average across the Southern border, which is currently seeing as many as 10,000 crossings per day.\n",
            "682: The recent echoes of the former president by Biden, who had long argued that Trump's border policies were inhumane, reflect the growing public concern about illegal migration.\n",
            "683: But Biden's stance threatens to alienate progressives who already believe he has shifted too far right on border policies.\n",
            "684: Biden could, in theory, strongly limit asylum claims and restrict crossings, but the effort would be almost certainly be challenged in court and would be far more likely to be blocked or curtailed dramatically without a congressional law backing the new changes.\n",
            "685: Trump is loath to give a win to Biden on an issue that animated the Republican’s successful 2016 campaign and that he wants to use as he seeks to return to the White House.\n",
            "686: Biden's embrace of the congressional framework points to how the administration's efforts to enact a broader immigration overhaul have been stymied.\n",
            "687: On his first day in office, Biden sent a comprehensive immigration proposal to Congress and signed more executive orders than Trump.\n",
            "688: Biden's aides and allies see the asylum changes as part of the crackdown effort and that's in part why they have been receptive to the proposals.\n",
            "689: This is the apocalyptic version of American life that President Donald Trump argues would be the dire consequence of turning over the White House to Democrat Joe Biden.\n",
            "690: \"He'll bury you in regulations, dismantle your police departments, dissolve our borders, confiscate your guns, terminate religious liberty, destroy your suburbs,\" Trump said in one of many over-the-top pronouncements about Biden in the campaign's final weeks.\n",
            "691: \"It's pure fear and fear based on a particular kind of ignorance that only works if your hearers have that particular kind of ignorance,\" Robin Lakoff, professor emerita of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, said of Trump's claims about Biden.\n",
            "692: Now, he is giving voters a laundry list of mostly implausible reasons to fear a Biden presidency.\n",

            "700: During a summer of unrest that followed the police killings of Black men, Trump sought to portray Biden as beholden to the \"radical-left\" forces Trump claimed were behind the protests.\n",
            "701: He also argued that Biden wouldn't be able to keep such unrest from spreading to the suburbs.\n",
            "702: David Zarefsky, who teaches courses about presidential rhetoric at Northwestern, said close examination shows the weakness in Trump's argument about Biden and the suburbs.\n",
            "703: In July, Biden said Trump was the country's first racist president, which glossed over the presidents before Trump who had held slaves.\n",

            "1025: Sams pointed to stories by CBS News, The Wall Street Journal, The Associated Press and others emphasizing that Hur had found evidence that Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified material.\n",
            "1026: It was Sams' second foray into press criticism in a few months; last fall he urged journalists to give more scrutiny to House Republicans and the reasons behind their impeachment inquiry of Biden.\n",
            "1027: In a separate statement, Biden campaign spokesman T.J. Ducklo criticized media outlets for time spent discussing the 81-year-old president's age and mental capacity, an issue that was raised anew when Biden addressed the Hur report with reporters.\n",
            "1028: To be fair, Trump's comments at a rally Friday night likely came past the deadlines of some sections where Biden stories appeared that weekend.\n",
            "1029: A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of The Times, noted in an interview with the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism that Biden's team had been “extremely upset” about its coverage lately.\n",
            "1030: The criticism comes amid the backdrop of unhappiness among some journalists about how much Biden is made available for questions — an issue that surfaced again when Biden turned down an opportunity to appear before tens of millions of Americans in an interview during the Super Bowl pregame show.\n",
            "1031: The 33 news conferences Biden has given during the first three years of his presidency is lower than any other American president in that time span since Ronald Reagan, said Martha Kumar, a Towson University professor emeritus and expert on presidents and the press.\n",
            "1032: Similarly, the 86 interviews Biden has given is lower than any president since she began studying records with Reagan.\n",
            "1033: Instead, Biden prefers more informal appearances where reporters ask a few questions, with comparatively little opportunity for follow-up, she said: The 535 such sessions that Biden conducted was second only to Trump's 572.\n",
            "1034: One example followed Biden's remarks Friday after the death of Russian dissident Aleksey Navalny.\n",
            "1035: Another was Biden's early evening availability following the release of Hur's report, a chaotic scene where reporters tried to outshout one another.\n",
            "1036: Some on Biden's team, meanwhile, believe the president showed a combativeness in the face of criticism that Americans will appreciate.\n",
            "1037: Sesno said he can understand the Biden team's worry that the president's fitness for the job becomes a story they lose control of, much like former President Gerald Ford's stumbles led to the perception that he was a bumbler.\n",
            "1038: Nikki Usher, a media professor at the University of San Diego, said she was surprised that Biden's team hadn't become more aggressive earlier.\n",
            "1039: The Biden pushback seems mild in comparison to Trump's epic badmouthing of news organizations like CNN and The New York Times.\n",
            "1040: Democrats, meanwhile, tend to have a greater appreciation for the press' role in a democracy, Usher says, so the Biden team has to be more careful with attacks.\n",
            "1041: Particularly with the age issue, there's only so much that the president's team can say, Sesno said: “People will make up their minds based on what they see and hear from Joe Biden.”\n",

            "1045: Let us hope that, unlike his predecessor, who needed, even demanded, fawning tributes to himself from his subordinates and secretaries, Joe Biden has instead the emotional security of President Gerald Ford and will insist on securing his own Stu Spencer.\n",
            "1046: WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden’s decision to go back on his word and issue a categorical pardon for his son, Hunter, just weeks before his scheduled sentencing on gun and tax convictions was a surprise that wasn't all that surprising.\n",
            "1047: Not to those who had witnessed the president’s shared anguish over his two sons after the boys survived a car crash that killed Biden's first wife and a daughter more than a half-century ago.\n",
            "1048: He added that while he could sympathize with Hunter Biden’s struggles, “no one is above the law, not a President and not a President’s son.”\n",
            "1049: Biden aides and allies had been resigned to the prospect of the president using his extraordinary power in the waning days of his presidency to ensure his son wouldn't see time behind bars, especially after Donald Trump ’s win.\n",
            "1050: The president's supporters have long viewed Biden's commitment to his family as an asset overall, even if Hunter's personal conduct and tangled business dealings were seen as a persistent liability.\n",
            "1051: But the pardon comes as Biden has become increasingly isolated since the loss to Trump by Vice President Kamala Harris, who jumped in to the race after the president’s catastrophic debate against Trump in June forced his exit from the election.\n",
            "1052: Trump has gleefully planned to undo Biden’s signature achievements on climate change and reverse the Democrat's efforts to reinvigorate the country’s alliances, all while standing poised to take credit for a strengthening economy and billions in infrastructure investments that are in the pipeline for the coming years.\n",
            "1053: And now, Biden has handed the Republican a pretext to carry through with sweeping plans to upend the Department of Justice as the Republican vows to seek retribution against supposed adversaries.\n",
            "1054: Well, Joe Biden just made clear his son Hunter is above the law.”\n",
            "1055: Biden and his spokespeople had repeatedly and flatly ruled out the president granting his son a pardon.\n",
            "1056: In June, Biden told reporters as his son faced trial in the Delaware gun case: “I abide by the jury decision.\n",
            "1057: Neither Biden nor the White House explained the shift in the president's thinking, and it was his broken promise as much as his act of clemency that was a lightning rod.\n",
            "1058: Yet Biden held himself up as placing his respect for the American judicial system and rule of law over his own personal concerns — trying to draw a deliberate contrast with Trump, who tested the bounds of his authority like few predecessors.\n",
            "1059: Inside the White House, the timing of the pardon was surprising to some who believed Biden would put it off as long as possible, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter.\n",
            "1060: It came just after Biden spent extended time over the past week with Hunter and other family members on Nantucket in Massachusetts, a family tradition for Thanksgiving.\n",
            "1061: “I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice — and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further,” Biden said in a statement announcing the pardon.\n",
            "1062: Some in the administration have privately expressed anguish that the substance of Biden’s statement, including his claim of an unfair politically-tinged prosecution of his son, resembled complaints Trump — who faced now-abandoned indictments over his role in trying to subvert the 2020 election — has been making for years about the Justice Department.\n",
            "1063: Biden said the charges in his son's cases \"came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election.” Many legal experts agreed that the charges against the younger Biden were somewhat unusual, but the facts of the offenses were hardly in dispute, as Hunter wrote about his gun purchase while addicted to illegal drugs in his memoir and ultimately pleaded guilty to the tax charges.\n",
            "1064: The pardon too was unusual, coming before Hunter Biden was even sentenced and covering not just the gun and tax offenses against his son, but also anything else he might have done going back to the start of 2014.\n",
            "1065: It's a move that could limit the ability of the Trump Justice Department to investigate the younger Biden's unsavory foreign business dealings, or to find new ground on which to bring criminal charges related to that time period.\n",
            "1066: Biden, in his statement, asked for consideration: “I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.\"\n",
            "1067: — The Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah was a “measure of justice” for victims of a four-decade “reign of terror,” President Joe Biden said Saturday.\n",
            "1068: Biden noted that the operation to take out Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas’ massacre of Israelis on Oct.\n",
            "1069: “Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a ‘northern front’ against Israel,” Biden said in a statement.\n",
            "1070: “President Biden and I do not want to see conflict in the Middle East escalate into a broader regional war,” Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement Saturday that echoed Biden's description of a “measure of justice.” She added, “Diplomacy remains the best path forward to protect civilians and achieve lasting stability in the region.”\n",
            "1071: The confirmation of Nasrallah's death comes during a week that began with Biden’s top national security aides working on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly to build support for a 21-day Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire that they hoped might also breathe new life into stalled efforts to secure a truce in Gaza.\n",
            "1072: Biden reiterated on Saturday that he wants to see cease-fires both in Gaza and between Israel and Hezbollah.\n",
            "1073: “It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability,” Biden said.\n",

            "1076: WASHINGTON — While Joe Biden and Donald Trump are marching toward their respective presidential nominations, Michigan's primary on Tuesday could reveal significant political perils for both of them.\n",
            "1077: Trump, despite his undoubted dominance of the Republican contests this year, is facing a bloc of stubbornly persistent GOP voters who favor his lone remaining rival, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, and who are skeptical at best about the former president's prospects in a rematch against Biden.\n",
            "1078: As for the incumbent president, Biden is confronting perhaps his most potent electoral obstacle yet: an energized movement of disillusioned voters upset with his handling of the war in Gaza and a relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that critics say has been too supportive.\n",
            "1079: Even if they post dominant victories as expected on Tuesday, both campaigns will be looking at the margins for signs of weakness in a state that went for Biden by just 3 percentage points last time.\n",
            "1080: Biden said in a local Michigan radio interview Monday that it would be “one of the five states” that would determine the winner in November.\n",

            "1082: Trump won the state by just 11,000 votes in 2016 over Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, and then lost the state four years later by nearly 154,000 votes to Biden.\n",
            "1083: “President Biden is failing to provide voters for whom the war crimes that are being inflicted by our U.S. taxpayer dollars — he’s failing to provide them with something to vote for.”\n",
            "1084: Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has also urged progressive voters to choose “uncommitted” on Tuesday, saying it would send a message to Biden to “change course NOW on Gaza or else risk losing Michigan to Trump in November.”\n",
            "1085: Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a Biden backer who held several meetings and listening sessions in Michigan late last week, said he told community members that, despite his disagreements over the war, he would nonetheless support Biden because he represents a much better chance of peace in the Middle East than Trump.\n",
            "1086: “I also said that I admire those who are using their ballot in a quintessentially American way to bring about a change in policy,” Khanna said Monday, adding that Biden supporters need to proactively engage with the uncommitted voters to try and “earn back their trust.”\n",
            "1087: Meanwhile, the state GOP has been riven with divisions among various pro-Trump factions, potentially weakening its power at a time when Michigan Republicans are trying to lay the groundwork to defeat Biden this fall.\n",

            "1100: It's a high-profile legislative fight in which Biden has notably taken a back seat, preferring to leave the work of crafting a compromise to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, in contrast to his fevered advocacy, both public and private, for his infrastructure bill and COVID-19 relief package.\n",
            "1101: Floyd family lawyer Ben Crump said Biden told them that \"he doesn't want to sign a bill that doesn't have substance and meaning.\n",

            "2086: Biden said he was horrified by Trump’s response, particularly when the Republican told reporters that “you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.”\n",

            "2097: In an office and basement den in the Delaware home, agents also found notebooks with classified information that Biden wrote on during briefings with Obama and in White House Situation Room meetings, the report said.\n",
            "2098: Investigators said the notebooks included national security and foreign policy information that touched on “sensitive intelligence sources and methods.” Hur found that on at least three occasions during interviews with his ghostwriter, Biden read aloud from classified parts from his notebooks “nearly verbatim.”\n",
            "2099: Hur concluded there is not enough evidence to convict Biden of “willfully” retaining the Afghanistan documents or the notebooks.\n",
            "2100: When the Afghanistan documents were found in the garage in 2022, Biden was allowed to have them because he was president at the time, the report said.\n",
            "2101: To bring charges, Hur said prosecutors would have to rely on a comment that Biden had made to his ghostwriter in 2017 — when Biden was a private citizen and living in Virginia — that he had “just found” classified documents downstairs.\n",
            "2102: But Hur said Biden could convince some jurors his actions weren't willful by arguing, for example, that he forgot about the documents shortly after finding them in 2017.\n",
            "2103: It's also possible the Afghanistan documents were never in the Virginia home at all, but were accidentally kept without Biden's knowledge in Delaware since he was vice president, Hur concluded.\n",
            "2104: Hur also cited limitations with Biden’s memory and the president's cooperation with investigators that “could convince some jurors that he made an innocent mistake.\n",
            "2105: “We have also considered that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,” the report said.\n",
            "2106: Regarding the notebooks containing classified information, Hur concluded that Biden could plausibly argue if there were a trial that he believed that the notebooks were his personal property and he was allowed to take them home.\n",
            "2107: “During our interview of him, Mr. Biden was emphatic, declaring that his notebooks are ‘my property’ and that ‘every president before me has done the exact same thing,’ that is, kept handwritten classified materials after leaving office,” the report said.\n",
            "2108: Other classified documents found at the Penn Biden Center, Biden's Delaware home, and among Senate papers at the University of Delaware “could plausibly have been brought to these locations by mistake,” Hur concluded.\n",
            "2109: Hur's report says the differences between the two cases are “clear.” Unlike Biden — who cooperated with investigators, agreed to searches of his homes and sat for a voluntary interview — the allegations in Trump's case present “serious aggravating facts,” Hur wrote.\n",

            "2134: By the end of the hour, Biden changed few if any minds about whether he should stay in the presidential race.\n",
