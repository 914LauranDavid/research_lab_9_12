            "3: Asked whether an invasion of Rafah, in the south of Gaza on the border with Egypt, was a red line, Biden replied in the affirmative: \"It is a red line.\"\n",
            "4: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is “hurting Israel more than helping Israel” in his approach to the war against Hamas in Gaza, Biden said.\n",
            "5: Netanyahu that “he must pay more attention to the innocent lives being lost as a consequence of the actions taken,” Biden said.\n",
            "6: The Biden administration said that it now wants to built a floating pier to help deliver large amounts of aid into Gaza.\n",
            "7: Even as Biden warned Israel's government against further targeting of the civilian population in Gaza, he reiterated his general support.\n",
            "8: Ever since Joe Biden won the U.S. presidency, the rhetoric from Europe’s leaders has been filled with anticipation of a new transatlantic dawn.\n",
            "9: Biden, a dyed-in-the-wool transatlanticist, pushed all the right buttons, stroking the Continent’s bruised ego after four years of relentless abuse.\n",
            "10: And Europe stands ready,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen declared on the occasion of Biden’s inauguration.\n",
            "11: Given the opportunity in recent weeks to show the Biden administration it was serious about geostrategic collaboration, Europe opted instead to show Washington the finger.\n",
            "12: In late December, for example, the EU, prodded by Germany, agreed to a landmark investment pact with China, ignoring objections from across the Atlantic and requests from the Biden camp to hold off until the new administration was in office.\n",
            "13: Whether Europe’s decision to effectively de-couple from the U.S. foreign policy agenda before Biden’s administration has really even begun is born out of a desire to achieve the dream of “strategic autonomy,” concern that Donald Trump could return in four years, or some combination thereof may not matter in the end.\n",
            "14: WASHINGTON — Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko denied Sunday that former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma Holdings, a gas company Biden’s son Hunter was a board member of.\n",
            "15: “My absolutely clear answer: no, never,” Poroshenko told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria on “Fareed Zakaria GPS.” “But I also cannot accept that, neither President Obama nor President Biden — Vice President Biden, nor President Trump, nor Vice President Pence never press[ed] me.”\n",
            "16: Poroshenko became president of Ukraine in 2014, the same year that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma, a gas company based in Kyiv.\n",
            "17: At the time, Vice President Biden was working with the others in the Obama administration to help reform policy and root out corruption in Ukraine.\n",
            "18: Hunter Biden served on the board until early 2019.\n",
            "19: U.S. President Donald Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have claimed, without corroborating evidence, that when he was vice president, Joe Biden inappropriately pressured Ukraine to remove a prosecutor who had launched an investigation into Burisma in order to protect his son.\n",
            "20: Trump was accused of abusing his power by urging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens to help his reelection.\n",
            "21: A majority of voters said it was inappropriate for Hunter Biden to be employed at Burisma while his father was leading the effort on policy change in Ukraine, according to a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll from February.\n",
            "22: Congressional Democrats supporting Biden’s presidential bid have pushed him to punch back harder against Trump’s accusations.\n",

            "24: China hit back at U.S. President Joe Biden, over a promise he made Sunday that the U.S. would defend self-governing Taiwan if Beijing was to launch an invasion.\n",

            "26: “Would U.S. forces defend the island?” Biden was asked on U.S. television, in an interview published Sunday night.\n",
            "27: The comment was Biden’s most unambiguous yet about U.S. policy toward Taiwan, which has long been governed by the Taiwan Relations Act and the doctrine of “strategic ambiguity” — the notion that the U.S. would remain purposely noncommittal about defending Taiwan.\n",
            "28: Mao Ning said that China had lodged a formal complaint with the U.S. over Biden’s comments, saying Beijing was “strongly dissatisfied,” and adding that the remarks sent a “seriously erroneous signal to Taiwanese separatist independence forces.”\n",
            "29: U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said Tuesday he is not sure Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump “even understands” what NATO’s Article 5 commitment to collective defense means, AFP reported.\n",
            "30: Biden, who is visiting the Latvian capital Riga, said the U.S. had “pledged our sacred honor” to fulfill the NATO requirement to treat an attack against one member country as an attack against all, Reuters reported.\n",
            "31: Biden said Tuesday ahead of talks with the presidents of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, that there was overwhelming bipartisan commitment to NATO in the U.S.\n",
            "32: Joe Biden is right to convene a summit of democracies at a time when autocracies are on the offensive against the free world.\n",
            "33: In her op-ed “Biden’s ‘summit of democracies’ won’t work” (December 8), Shada Islam argues that interests and values often do not align across the free world.\n",
            "34: President-Elect Biden opened the first Copenhagen Democracy Summit and co-founded our Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity to curb election meddling.\n",
            "35: LONDON — Joe Biden inherits a formidable in-tray from Donald Trump — but on trade talks with Britain, plenty of work has already been done.\n",
            "36: One former U.S. official familiar with plans to engage with the U.K. after Biden’s January inauguration said the new administration is expected to take a more gradual and cautious approach to trade overall when compared to the Trump regime.\n",
            "37: On Thursday and Friday, U.S. President Joe Biden will gather leaders from over 100 countries to a virtual “Summit for Democracy.” He invited rule-of-law troublemaker Poland.\n",
            "38: The guest list for Biden’s democracy summit has been a source of speculation since he first floated the idea on the campaign trail.\n",
            "39: BERLIN — Joe Biden took office nearly four years ago on a mission to repair America’s relationship with Europe — and then Vladimir Putin swept in and did it for him.\n",
            "40: Biden is due to arrive in Germany on Thursday night for a brief visit to both celebrate the new spirit of transatlantic solidarity and discuss what the West can do to hamper the Russian president’s progress in Ukraine.\n",
            "41: For all the inevitable talk about the importance of the alliance between their two nations, Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have left the world with a frozen conflict in Ukraine.\n",
            "42: That’s why Biden’s visit to Berlin promises to be more of a counseling session than a valediction.\n",
            "43: Biden later reversed that decision.\n",
            "44: In contrast to Trump, Biden bent over backwards — long before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine — to soothe German fears about Washington’s commitment to their security.\n",
            "45: Just a few weeks after taking office in 2021, Biden participated in the Munich Security Conference, albeit virtually from the White House.\n",
            "46: In the months that followed, Biden appointed a parade of Germany-friendly officials to key positions on the National Security Council and in the State Department.\n",
            "47: In early 2022 Biden dispatched Amy Gutmann as his ambassador to Germany.\n",
            "48: For official Germany, which had spent four years fretting about what special torment Trump might have in store for them next, the rhetoric from Biden and his surrogates was a welcome salve.\n",
            "49: Against that backdrop, the relationship between Biden and Scholz, who took office just weeks before the Russian invasion in February 2022, was close from the get-go.\n",
            "50: “Scholz and Biden’s strategy of boiling the frog slowly in Ukraine did not really work,” said Jana Puglierin, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n",
            "51: If nothing else, Biden’s visit to Berlin — which was originally scheduled for earlier this month but was delayed due to a hurricane in the U.S. — will offer the two leaders time to reflect on what they should have done differently.\n",
            "52: Yet Biden’s farewell trip has mostly generated yawns.\n",
            "53: Scholz’s three-party coalition has been on the rocks for months, and he’s unlikely to serve another term as chancellor; he might even end up ‘doing a Biden’ before Germany’s 2025 election.\n",
            "54: Meanwhile, Biden’s visit, instead of cementing his legacy in Europe, will likely be little more than a reminder of what might have been.\n",
            "55: The Obama administration is sending Vice President Joe Biden to make peace with Turkey.\n",
            "56: Biden’s office on Saturday confirmed reports out of Turkey that he would visit the country on August 24, roughly a month and a half after a failed coup attempt in the strategically located NATO ally.\n",
            "57: Biden will likely attempt to smooth the escalating tensions between Washington and Ankara during his trip.\n",
            "58: Huawei's problems in Western capitals around the world may deepen under U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who is expected to replace Donald Trump's combative diplomacy against the Chinese telecom giant with a more united international effort to keep Beijing from dominating the internet.\n",
            "59: Insiders at Huawei cautiously welcomed Biden's victory in the Nov.\n",
            "60: They also foresee Biden maintaining or even extending the Trump-driven pressure campaign that has crippled Huawei, strained the global telecom sector and dragged others from software giants to chipmakers into the fight.\n",
            "61: Biden is likely to bring “less noise and more content,” said Viviane Reding, former European commissioner for justice who has emerged as a strong critic of Trump’s demands for bans on Huawei in Europe.\n",
            "62: “I hope and expect the Biden administration will show genuine interest in working with allies to create alternatives.\n",
            "63: That kind of coalition means Biden could succeed where Trump didn’t: In building a global coalition of democracies that could join forces politically and on industrial terms to counter China's rise on tech.\n",
            "64: European officials are already working to set up structures to embrace the expected Biden approach.\n",
            "65: While Biden has not detailed a specific Huawei strategy, he has said he will put global cooperation at the center of efforts to counter China’s tech offensive: \"To win the competition for the future against China or anyone else, the United States must sharpen its innovative edge and unite the economic might of democracies around the world,\" Biden wrote in a piece outlining his foreign policy in Foreign Affairs in March.\n",
            "66: “The most effective way to meet that challenge is to build a united front of U.S. allies and partners,” Biden wrote.\n",
            "67: Tony Blinken, Biden’s choice for leading the State Department, told Reuters this summer that Biden would seek to use NATO to address Chinese threats to global security, which could include Huawei’s attempts at making 5G inroads in Europe.\n",
            "68: Or, as Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Biden’s nominee for U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said last week: “America is back.\n",
            "69: The global effect of Trump’s style, according to Pallone, was to “sow doubt and confusion among our partners and allies.” He expects a steadier approach under Biden, with many in Congress ready to partner with the new administration, will be more effective.\n",
            "70: If Biden wants to succeed in bringing back multilateral cooperation, he will have relationships to smooth out.\n",
            "71: In Canada, government insiders anticipate a friendlier stance from Biden, who is politically close to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n",
            "72: But several people inside the Trudeau government say they are not assuming that a Biden White House will make substantive changes in U.S. demands on Canada regarding Huawei.\n",
            "73: Rob Strayer, a former State Department official who spearheaded Trump’s Huawei campaign and now works at tech industry association ITI, argued that “the coalition-building will be not all that different” under Biden.\n",
            "74: But, he added that Biden’s focus would be on working through more formal structures like the G20, G7 or the World Trade Organization and include “the softer form of multilateralism of building a coalition of the like-minded.”\n",
            "75: Biden “will understand these issues,” he added.\n",
            "76: Biden has emphasized U.S.’ and allies’ strengths in research and innovation and his long-term plan to push back on — rather than indulge — protectionist tendencies.\n",
            "77: Those measures are largely expected to remain in place once Biden is in office.\n",
            "78: Steve Berry, who heads a trade group of U.S. rural wireless carriers known as the Competitive Carriers Association and discussed these issues with Biden transition team members last week, expects “no major change” in how the U.S. assesses the dangers of Chinese gear, he said.\n",
            "79: Berry is seeking to secure more than $1.5 billion from U.S. lawmakers now for a subsidy program to help a few dozen rural carriers in the U.S. rid their networks of equipment from Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese telecom company network equipment, a bipartisan issue on Capitol Hill and one he stressed to Biden’s team.\n",
            "80: There are also a number of China hawks in the Senate who could push Biden’s cabinet nominees to take a strong stance on Huawei.\n",
            "81: Senator Marco Rubio (R.-Fla.), a frequent Huawei critic, last week called Biden’s early cabinet picks “polite and orderly caretakers of America’s decline” in a tweet, adding “I have no interest in returning to the ‘normal’ that left us dependent on China.”\n",
            "82: In the U.K., the position is unlikely to change under Biden, Martin said.\n",
            "83: He said even if Biden were to roll back sanctions, the possibility that they could be reinstated would loom.\n",
            "84: If Biden decides to exert less pressure on these countries, it could leave them more wiggle room with how severe they make their restrictions.\n",
            "85: For Biden’s incoming administration, the challenge will be to build actual consensus in the West on how to handle China’s technological rise — without alienating foreign governments with a long list of tech-related issues they want the Biden administration to take on.\n",
            "86: It’s a lot for Biden and allied countries to reconcile as they push back against Chinese technology giants like Huawei.\n",
            "87: If most European leaders now desperately want a new man in the White House — someone who can bring sanity and dignity to the Oval Office and U.S. policies — working with Joe Biden won’t fix what’s ailing the relationship overnight.\n",
            "88: And yet, there are still plenty of potential pitfalls that could come with a Biden presidency.\n",
            "89: That won’t be the case anymore under Biden.\n",
            "90: Biden — despite anti-China rhetoric during his campaign and cross-party support for taking a tough line on Beijing — is likely to be less confrontational and more willing to listen to the EU’s view of China as a systemic rival, competitor and partner.\n",
            "91: That won’t be such a bad development: If Biden does succeed in his ambition to put “America back at the head of the table,” a strong and self-confident Europe with its own networks of power and influence can be a real partner for America — not just a pushover.\n",
            "92: The comments come after it was widely reported that U.S. President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range missiles, also known as the Army Tactical Missile System or ATACMS, for strikes on Russian territory.\n",
            "93: The move marks a major shift in U.S. policy after the Biden administration’s long-standing refusal to agree to Ukraine’s request for authorization to use the missiles to hit targets outside its own borders.\n",
            "94: Biden’s approval came in response to Russia’s use of North Korean troops in the war, The New York Times reported.\n",
            "95: However, Biden’s decision to allow strikes into Russia “will not change” the balance of power on the battlefield, a high-level French military official told reporters Monday.\n",
            "96: Joe Biden’s decision to pull U.S. forces out of Afghanistan by September 11 this year gave NATO allies their marching orders — they had little choice but to salute smartly and declare their troops will follow suit.\n",
            "97: Some officials from the NATO countries most involved in Afghanistan said they appreciated the consultation undertaken by the Biden administration, which contrasted sharply with the rough treatment they suffered under Donald Trump.\n",
            "98: Biden sent his secretaries of state and defense to Brussels this week to discuss the move and they stood shoulder to shoulder with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg to announce it.\n",
            "99: Biden made clear the U.S. and its allies will be gone by September, come what may.\n",
            "100: “President Biden made clear on the campaign trail that he intended to withdraw from the so-called ‘forever war,’ and so this decision was a question of when, not if,” said Joyce Anelay, a former minister in the U.K. Foreign Office who is chair of the House of Lords’ international relations committee.\n",
            "101: Anelay said Biden’s final withdrawal date of September 11 was better that Trump’s planned deadline of May 1.\n",
            "102: James Schwemlein, a former senior adviser to the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan at the U.S. Department of State, said the timeline made an orderly allied withdrawal “very possible.” Schwemlein, now an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, described Biden’s decision as “the best available bad option.”\n",
            "103: U.S. President Joe Biden appointed Pressman envoy to Hungary in 2022.\n",
            "104: Boris Johnson has work to do to woo Joe Biden should he become US president next week.\n",
            "105: LONDON — If Joe Biden wins on Tuesday, corks will pop in many European capitals.\n",
            "106: Prime Minister Boris Johnson has more ground to make up than most in the international race to be Biden’s No. 1 international ally, a station long-desired (and sometimes occupied) by British prime ministers.\n",
            "107: The prime minister's association with Brexit — which Biden strongly opposed — his warm words for Donald Trump, and his past comments about some of Biden’s closest political allies don’t position him well.\n",
            "108: The opposition Labour Party’s Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy told POLITICO that Johnson and his government had “needlessly and repeatedly created tension with the Democrats” — her words a sign that Labour spies a potential weak spot should Biden win, and Johnson fail to strike up a good partnership with him.\n",
            "109: More positively, the U.K. — about to become G7 president, due to hold the UN Security Council presidency in February and hosting the COP26 climate conference in December 2021 — will have ample opportunities in the first 12 months of a Biden administration to demonstrate that, despite Brexit, its broader foreign policy goals fit hand in glove with Biden’s own.\n",
            "110: U.K. officials have struggled, like all diplomats, to gain access to Biden’s inner circle (the Democrat's campaign has observed strict rules over meeting foreign officials to avoid any suggestion of outside influence following the scandal over Russian interference to boost Trump last time around).\n",
            "111: But they remain confident that longstanding ties with Democrats on Capitol Hill, not to mention a dormant Democratic foreign policy establishment currently plying their trade at think tanks and in academia, will help them persuade an incoming Biden administration that there remains more to Britain than Brexit.\n",
            "112: Here's how Johnson's administration might assess some of the key challenges it faces building bridges with a Biden White House:\n",
            "113: U.K. officials deny the government’s Brexit priorities — and the identity of the prime minister — have left British diplomats scrambling to get to know Team Biden.\n",
            "114: But officials also acknowledge privately what observers outside government state plainly: Biden deeply regrets the U.K.’s exit from the EU — and he might not immediately warm to Johnson either.\n",
            "115: \"The Biden team will not have forgotten the rudeness shown by Boris Johnson towards Obama and Hillary Clinton,” said Peter Westmacott, the U.K.’s ambassador to the U.S. from 2012 to 2016.\n",
            "116: However, he said, while the two international agendas won't align on everything, Biden may see Johnson as a \"natural ally\" on several fronts.\n",
            "117: “The personal relationship between Biden and Johnson will be the difficult one,” said former U.K Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind.\n",
            "118: “Biden will be a bit stiff to start off with.\n",
            "119: Biden is deep, deep Irish-American and therefore a bit untrusting of any British politicians with a track record on Ireland; and Johnson unfortunately has created a track record.”\n",
            "120: “Biden, whatever doubts he has about Johnson personally, is long in the tooth,” Rifkind said, and like those predecessors would recognize that despite not seeing eye to eye on everything, the U.K. is a unique friend to have in Europe.\n",
            "121: Biden knows all that.”\n",
            "122: Douglas Lute, a retired U.S. army general who served as ambassador to NATO under Obama from 2013 to 2017, agreed that common interests and military and intelligence ties should not be underestimated when rating the strength of the U.S.-U.K. relationship under a potential Biden administration.\n",
            "123: Biden would want to “refresh” U.S. relations with allies but also “ask more” of them, Lute predicted, “including a renewed emphasis on democratic values and the reimagining of national security to include such challenges as pandemics, climate and cyber.”\n",
            "124: The U.K., as one of only 10 NATO countries spending the target 2 percent of GDP on defense, is likely to be in Biden’s good books on that score, believes Kim Darroch, U.K ambassador to the U.S. from 2016 to 2019.\n",
            "125: He told Spectator TV earlier this month that “repairing the damage to NATO” would be one of Biden’s top two European priorities, alongside repairing relations with the EU.\n",
            "126: “A Biden administration will expect the U.K. to sustain this defense commitment while also playing a leading political role in redefining security to account for new challenges,” he said.\n",
            "127: In one respect, the U.K. has been dealt a good hand in 2021 if it wants to show willing and support Biden’s professed foreign policy goals of renewing alliances between democracies, strengthening international institutions within the UN and taking action on climate change.\n",
            "128: London holds the rotating presidency of the G7 next year, and British officials see an opportunity to align Johnson’s embryonic idea of a expanded “D10” group of democratic allies — G7 nations plus three others, potentially India, South Korea and Australia — with Biden’s plan for a “summit for democracy” early in his term.\n",
            "129: Meanwhile, the U.K. holds the rotating presidency of the United Nations Security Council in February, which would be Biden’s first full month in office.\n",
            "130: Biden, who has vowed to restore U.S. leadership in international health and aid, will — British officials hope — see the U.K. as a useful lieutenant in such efforts.\n",
            "131: With Biden vowing to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on his first day in office and to put the U.S. on the road to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, some spy an opportunity for Johnson to play his right-hand man in drumming up ambitious carbon-cutting pledges from countries around the world.\n",
            "132: “It’s one of the few areas where the U.K. has global influence that the U.S. [under Biden] would want to align with,” said Nick Mabey, CEO of the E3G climate think-tank.\n",
            "133: “Biden has already set out a very ambitious agenda on climate both at home and abroad and would obviously galvanise the international system,” said one U.K. official.\n",
            "134: The key concern for London is not so much that Biden won’t want to do a trade agreement, it’s whether he’ll devote sufficient time and political impetus to the process to wrap it up before a looming deadline.\n",
            "135: “Generally, it’s questionable whether Biden will be as focussed on trade policy or trade deals as Trump has been,\" said Stephen Booth, head of the Policy Exchange think tank’s Britain in the World project and author of a report on the U.S. deal.\n",
            "136: \"It’s fair to say that Biden is unlikely to attach the same importance or urgency to a U.K. deal as Trump.\n",
            "137: Biden might also make more of repairing the U.S.'s political relationship with the EU in the first instance.”\n",
            "138: Should negotiations continue in earnest — and, should he win, U.K. officials will be closely watching to see how quickly Biden appoints a trade representative (which often takes time) — the main sticking points, namely around U.S. food exports, will be the same, Booth expects.\n",
            "139: Some U.K. officials anticipate a Biden administration will also place greater emphasis on labor and environmental protections, but are confident this won’t prove a stumbling block.\n",
            "140: In the longer-term, Booth said, there is a chance Biden will embrace the idea of rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, something which the U.K. is also keen to join in its current revised form and renamed the “Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership” (CPTPP.) “This would present another route to a U.K.-U.S. trade deal,” Booth said.\n",
            "141: U.S. President Joe Biden closed his first virtual summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping with a focus on economic competition, human rights and strategic risks including Taiwan.\n",
            "142: While Xi called on America to stop suppressing Chinese businesses on the ground of national security, Biden shed light on Beijing's \"unfair trade and economic practices\" and the U.S. policy to work with allies to \"stand up for its interests and values.\"\n",
            "143: \"President Biden also underscored the importance of managing strategic risks.\n",

            "290: “I can assure you that we are looking for ways to go even further toward meeting the collective goal of mobilizing $100 billion a year,” Biden said Friday of his previous commitment to double U.S. climate aid by 2024.\n",
            "291: There were “very big expectations” that when Biden came to office he would pay his “arrears” to the fund, said Mohamed Nasr, an Egyptian diplomat who negotiates climate finance issues on behalf of the African group of nations.\n",
            "292: Governments, chiefly the EU and the U.K., have been privately prodding the Biden administration to up the ante, said Jake Schmidt, senior strategic director of international climate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an NGO.\n",
            "293: Later on the day of von der Leyen's speech, a senior Biden administration official was asked during a press call whether the U.S. planned to increase its climate finance pledge.\n",
            "294: Kerry himself has been optimistic about the prospect of more money, and Biden told G7 leaders in June a “conjectural figure” he anticipated being able to announce before COP26.\n",
            "295: Biden officials have noted Congress controls government spending.\n",
            "296: “They want to do more, they’re looking to do more and given pressure from other countries it wouldn’t shock me if there was an announcement before COP26 relatively soon,” another person who had spoken with Kerry’s team said of the Biden administration’s climate finance ambitions.\n",
            "297: Power was speaking at a press conference on the Armenia-Azerbaijan border, and said she had been sent by U.S. President Joe Biden on a fact-finding mission.\n",
            "298: GENEVA — For the rest of the world, the Back-to-the-Future spectacle of Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin re-enacting Cold War diplomacy offered a clear silver lining: at least America and Russia are talking again, creating a glint of hope that the two presidents might actually be able to do business.\n",
            "299: Biden called the discussion “good, positive.\n",
            "300: Asked if he trusted Putin, Biden put a spin on one of Reagan’s best-known sayings.\n",
            "301: But especially for EU allies counting on Biden to help them escape what European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called a “negative spiral” in relations with Russia, there will now need to be quite a bit of trust that the U.S. leader can forge a partnership with a man who confounded, and at times infuriated, four previous American presidents.\n",
            "302: Biden said that the face-to-face meeting on Wednesday was a crucial start, and suggested he believed he could succeed where others had failed.\n",
            "303: “I know we make foreign policy out to be some great skill somehow, it’s like a secret code,” Biden said.\n",
            "304: In reference to Biden once saying he believed Putin was a killer, the Russian president raised the issue of civilian deaths from U.S. drone strikes in Afghanistan or Iraq.\n",
            "305: But Biden, during his news own conference, made a clear, forceful presentation that appeared to represent the start of an effort to recognize Russia’s interests, while not compromising on Western values, and to erode Putin’s long-practiced victimization routine, in which he insists to his citizens that the U.S. and its allies are simply against Russia and will never change.\n",
            "306: “I told President Putin my agenda is not against Russia or anyone else; it’s for the American people,” Biden said.\n",
            "307: “I also told him that no president of the United States could keep faith with the American people if they did not speak out to defend our democratic values, to stand up for the universal rights and fundamental freedoms that all men and women have, in our view,” Biden said.\n",
            "308: Biden’s approach was a stunning contrast to Donald Trump’s handling of a joint news conference after his own summit with Putin in Helsinki in 2018, where he allowed Putin to speak for him, and for the U.S., and where Trump effectively said he trusted Putin more than his own U.S. intelligence services.\n",
            "309: Biden, by contrast, said he had informed Putin of 16 types of critical infrastructure that he said should be off-limits to cyberattacks, and other red lines such as zero tolerance for election meddling.\n",
            "310: “The bottom line is, I told President Putin that we need to have some basic rules of the road that we can all abide by,” Biden said.\n",
            "311: Biden, by contrast, took questions only from U.S. media outlets.\n",
            "312: And Biden’s assertion that the U.S. does not ever meddle in elections drew snorts, given ample historic evidence that the U.S. has interceded in numerous elections, including in Latin America and the Middle East.\n",
            "313: “I did what I came to do: Number one: identify areas of practical work our two countries can do to advance our mutual interests and also benefit the world,” Biden said.\n",
            "314: Biden was a tad more optimistic.\n",
            "315: In the U.S., some Republicans quickly accused Biden of not being tough enough, especially about Russia’s pattern of malign activity, and for not taking stronger steps, for example, to stop the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project.\n",
            "316: But Samuel Charap, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, said that there was a chance Biden and Putin could build a new relationship and that expecting any contrition, let alone an apology, from Russia was unrealistic.\n",
            "317: President Barack Obama endorsed Joe Biden’s White House bid on Tuesday, formally throwing his support behind his former vice president and the now-presumptive Democratic nominee.\n",
            "318: And that’s why I’m so proud to endorse Joe Biden for president of the United States.”\n",
            "319: Bernie Sanders also endorsed Biden’s candidacy.\n",
            "320: Obama’s endorsement, while widely expected, also represents a new phase in the general election campaign against President Donald Trump, unlocking the Democratic Party’s most powerful surrogate for Biden at a time when his campaign has struggled to cultivate momentum amid the outbreak of the coronavirus in the U.S.\n",
            "321: Although Biden maintained during the primary that he had asked Obama not to endorse any particular Democratic candidate — insisting that “whoever wins this nomination should win it on their own merits” — he relentlessly invoked his eight years of service under the former president and close personal relationship with him to court voters.\n",
            "322: Biden’s efforts to align himself so closely with Obama, even as the previous administration’s policies came under occasional scrutiny from the party’s left flank, were ultimately successful in propelling him past more progressive rivals to become Democrats’ pick to challenge Trump in November.\n",
            "323: His tenure as Obama’s No. 2 also contributed immeasurably to Biden’s firewall of support among African-American voters and proved foundational to the campaign’s argument that the former vice president was a capable, experienced leader ready to assume the responsibilities of the Oval Office.\n",
            "324: Weighing in on the endorsement Tuesday, Brad Parscale, Trump’s reelection campaign manager, asserted that Obama “spent much of the last five years urging Joe Biden not to run for president out of fear that he would embarrass himself,” and now “has no other choice but to support him.”\n",
            "325: “Obama was right in the first place: Biden is a bad candidate who will embarrass himself and his party,” Parscale said in a statement.\n",
            "326: When Biden officially entered the race last April, the former president’s spokeswoman said Obama “relied on the vice president’s knowledge, insight and judgment throughout both campaigns and the entire presidency,” and added that the two men “forged a special bond over the last 10 years.”\n",
            "327: The attorney general will be the latest member of Biden’s Cabinet to make a trip to the war-torn country.\n",
            "328: Campaign representatives for both Joe Biden and President Donald Trump declined to answer questions on their plans for the EU.\n",
            "329: Speaking to French media, he hinted that a Biden presidency could help to defuse mounting tensions over the tax.\n",
            "330: Trump administration officials have been explicit that they will trigger tariffs if any country starts levying the tax, while experts argue that a Biden presidency would be unlikely to take a fundamentally different approach.\n",
            "331: While Biden has said the U.S. should set privacy standards “not unlike the Europeans,” federal privacy legislation would take years to enact, if it is ever approved at all.\n",
            "332: Both Biden and his pick for vice president, Kamala Harris, have been known for taking a friendlier stance toward Big Tech than their counterparts on the left of the Democratic Party.\n",
            "333: That said, Harris has shown interest in addressing algorithmic bias and Biden's campaign promises to \"ensure the technologies of the future like AI are bound by laws and ethics.”\n",
            "334: It’s unclear exactly how Biden will address 5G security, or if he will pursue the Trump administration’s withering anti-Huawei \"Clean Network\" campaign.\n",
            "335: But Biden himself has so far been discrete about his plans on Big Tech, with some saying Europe and the U.S. could come together on lower-hanging fruit: content moderation, for which Biden has advocated regulation, in line with what the EU is doing with the Digital Services Act.\n",
            "336: Joe Biden wants to secure a political agreement with the European Union to restore confidence in data flowing across the Atlantic when he meets leaders in Brussels on June 15, according to five people with knowledge of the talks.\n",
            "337: The deal that Biden is seeking — in the form of a high-level political agreement with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during the upcoming EU-U.S. summit — would lay the groundwork for a new transatlantic data transfer deal, according to the five people, who spoke to Digital Bridge, POLITICO's transatlantic tech newsletter, on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the talks.\n",
            "338: Biden is expected to urge von der Leyen to back a political agreement around a new data transfer agreement, according to sources in both Washington and Brussels.\n",
            "339: Underscoring how much Washington is putting on this diplomatic full-court press, Gina Raimondo, the U.S. commerce secretary, and Katherine Tai, the U.S. trade representative, are expected to join Biden during his visit to Brussels.\n",
            "340: The upcoming trip marks the first time that Biden and von der Leyen will meet in person to hammer out thorny issues from combating climate change to rebuilding the global economy hit by the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
            "341: Since taking office in January, Biden's administration has put forward suggestions to meet the EU's concerns over how the bloc's data is handled in the U.S., according to two individuals with knowledge of the matter who did not provide specifics on the recommendations.\n",
            "342: After the White House proposed including data transfers in the upcoming EU-U.S. summit, two EU officials said they were surprised that the Biden administration was doubling down on the issue when both sides' negotiating teams remained far apart on how best to solve the outstanding issues linked to U.S. government surveillance.\n",
            "343: U.S. President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have “in principle” agreed to hold a bilateral summit followed by a meeting with all relevant parties on the security situation in Europe, after both leaders spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday, the Elysée said.\n",
            "344: Macron’s second call with Putin came after the French president spoke with Biden for around 15 minutes.\n",
            "345: In its readout, the Elysée said Macron had proposed the summit between Biden and Putin, and then with all parties, “to discuss security and strategic stability in Europe,” with Biden and Putin having “both accepted the principle of such a summit.”\n",
            "346: President Biden accepted in principle a meeting with President Putin following that engagement, again, if an invasion hasn’t happened.”\n",
            "347: Vice President Joe Biden took a hard stand against Russian leader Vladimir Putin in a speech at the Brookings Institution Wednesday, saying the situation in Ukraine is a “humanitarian tragedy created by Russian aggression.”\n",
            "348: Biden’s comments did not directly contradict those of Secretary of State John Kerry, who met with his Russian counterpart in Sochi earlier this month, but Biden did strike a tougher tone in dealing with the Russian government.\n",
            "349: But Biden put the onus of Minsk almost entirely on Russia while praising Ukraine’s pro-western government.\n",
            "350: “The United States sanctions on Russia must and will remain in place until the Minsk agreement is fully implemented,” Biden said, adding that there’s “no way to know that until the end of the year.” He also doubled down on America’s commitment to funding Ukrainian military equipment and basic training.\n",
            "351: Biden also decried Russian corruption around the globe, saying that “Russia and others are using corruption and oligarchs as tools.”\n",
            "352: Later in the speech, Biden said tension with Russia over the situation in Ukraine does not mean that the two countries should not cooperate on other global issues, like the nuclear negotiations with Iran and combating terrorism.\n",
            "353: And as world democracies gather virtually at United States President Joe Biden’s Summit for Democracy this week, the invitees — including 26 member countries of the European Union — should view them as such.\n",
            "354: Biden thus understandably opted for a wide tent approach to his list of participants: More than 100 countries will be present at the summit, several of which stand out as weak democracies or visibly display authoritarian traits.\n",
            "355: Indeed, the latter two countries did not even make it onto Biden’s rather generous list of invitations.\n",
            "356: Keir Starmer has denied that Joe Biden is senile or too old to be president of the United States.\n",
            "357: Biden is under increasing pressure to withdraw from the November presidential election, following an often incoherent debate performance last month that put his mental acuity under the spotlight.\n",
            "358: With presidential rival Donald Trump consistently leading in the polls, a growing number of Democratic Congress reps and even actor George Clooney, a major party fundraiser, have said Biden should withdraw from the race.\n",
            "359: Asked during a sit-down interview with the BBC whether the president had appeared “senile” during their meeting, Starmer rejected the suggestion, saying Biden was “absolutely across the detail.”\n",
            "360: It was the first time the U.K’s new prime minister, who was elected last week and is in Washington for the NATO summit, had met Biden.\n",
            "361: Biden is emphatically resisting calls to withdraw from the presidential race and has framed such demands as a struggle between himself and Democratic party “elites,” in a number of interviews and speeches.\n",
            "362: “I don’t care what those big names think,” Biden said during a Monday interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program, after the hosts listed some prominent Democrats who have called on him to step aside.\n",
            "363: Perhaps the easiest way to limit the damage caused by Joe Biden is to play the music from classic TV comedy “Curb Your Enthusiasm” after every public pronouncement.\n",
            "364: Biden, as you will by now be aware, mixed up Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin at the NATO summit (and let’s be clear, Biden could have mixed up Zelenskyy with anyone else in the world — Liz Truss, Darth Vader, the wolf that killed Ursula von der Leyen’s pet pony — and it would have been less embarrassing).\n",
            "365: But if Biden had simply turned to camera, gave a knowing look, perhaps widened his eyes and arched his eyebrows before the “Curb” music kicked in, we might be talking about his comedy genius rather than wondering how on earth this man is going to stop Donald Trump — because if Trump is the lucid one, we’re all screwed.\n",
            "366: And it’s another Italian who could be the person to save Biden and therefore the entire future of Western democracy, if that’s not hyperbole (which it definitely isn’t) … Giorgia Meloni.\n",
            "367: We saw a classic of the genre this week at the NATO summit in which Meloni — waiting for, you’ve guessed it, Biden — gave a ludicrously exaggerated eye-roll before pretending to check a watch she wasn’t wearing.\n",
            "368: So why don’t we simply combine the talents (and I use that word both advisedly and incorrectly) of Biden and Meloni and have her stand next to him during all public events?\n",
            "369: But with the survival of the free world at stake, I ask you to bear with me: this way, when Biden confuses Kamala Harris and Donald Trump — as also happened at NATO — then she can immediately swoop in with a massive eye-roll and everyone will be too busy laughing to realize the awfulness of what’s going on.\n",
            "370: If, for example, Meloni was about to further tighten immigration rules or appoint fans of the Mussolini family to her government, then Biden could cut through the tension by, say, mixing up Emmanuel Macron and François Mitterrand!\n",
            "371: Just look at Joe Biden.\n",
            "372: Biden, though loved by his party faithful, has the dubious distinction of having the lowest approval rating of any president at this stage of his term with the exception of Donald Trump.\n",
            "373: Introducing the Biden Compatibility Index, a ranking of countries according to their affinity to the US president.\n",
            "374: How close are Joe Biden and Europe, really?\n",
            "375: While Biden’s election as U.S. president brought relief in (most) European capitals, it has done little to erode the distrust accumulated during the four years of Donald Trump’s presidency.\n",
            "376: Introducing the Biden Compatibility Index.\n",
            "377: Great move; you made Biden’s day.\n",
            "378: And if you’re one of those countries that would have voted for Trump over Biden, don’t complain when the new guy gives you the stink eye.\n",
            "379: Overall, Biden has plenty of reasons to be happy with how Europe is behaving.\n",
            "380: And try as he might, Biden has had no luck convincing Germany to abandon the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will ship natural gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea.\n",
            "381: The U.S.’s image in Europe has improved substantially after Biden’s inauguration — perhaps not surprisingly, considering his popularity on the Continent was high even prior to his election.\n",
            "382: Whatever trust Biden may have regained, relations aren’t completely rosy.\n",
            "383: Once described by Joe Biden as a Trump “clone,” Johnson gave a Munich Security Conference speech that positioned himself as the optimistic champion of the transatlantic alliance Donald Trump so often scorned.\n",
            "384: In a speech clearly targeted at a Biden administration keen to rebuild ties with European allies, he sought to ease post-Brexit anxieties, insisting “our commitment to European security is unconditional and immoveable” and highlighted how the U.K.’s recent increase in defense spending would make the U.K. the second-biggest NATO contributor after the United States.\n",
            "385: The U.K. prime minister, who as foreign secretary during the Trump era told U.S. diplomats of his belief that the president was indeed “making America great again,” struck a very different tone in one of his first major foreign policy speeches of the Biden era.\n",
            "386: Speaking later at the security conference, which also heard from Biden, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, Johnson deployed another of his political trademarks: insatiable optimism.\n",
            "387: The Biden campaign has been studying the ’18 midterms.\n",
            "388: No, not the ones two years ago when Democrats took over the House by aggressively recruiting moderates and sweeping swing districts across the country, a precursor to Biden’s own centrist strategy in the Democratic presidential primaries this year.\n",
            "389: “We went back and looked at voting in 1918,” said Anita Dunn, one of Biden’s top advisers, “where of course turnout was down, but the election was still held, and Congress was still seated.”\n",
            "390: “Everything that’s happening right now is like nothing I’ve experienced in previous presidential campaigns.” — Anita Dunn, Joe Biden’s top adviser\n",
            "391: The search for historical precedents by Biden’s top strategists to help understand the bizarre new reality of running a presidential campaign in a country gripped by a pandemic underscores how totally the politics of 2020 changed in March.\n",
            "392: Biden’s Philadelphia headquarters has been cleared out.\n",
            "393: “Everybody’s working remotely across the whole campaign,” said Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s communications director.\n",
            "394: The presumed date by which Biden’s delegate nerds predicted Vermont Sen.\n",
            "395: Biden had planned to use a predicted victory in Georgia on Tuesday to essentially end the race by declaring that he had achieved “an insurmountable delegate lead.”\n",
            "396: Instead, the Georgia primary was moved to May and Biden retreated to a makeshift studio in his basement at home in Delaware to broadcast Zoom videos that have had to compete — poorly, so far — with briefings from elected officials like Trump and Gov.\n",
            "397: With many remaining primaries getting kicked to May and June, Biden might not be able to deliver his “insurmountable delegate lead” line until the summer.\n",
            "398: And while the pandemic has essentially erased Sanders from the news, there is an undercurrent of frustration — and a little nervousness — among some Biden aides that he has been robbed of a clean victory as the presumptive nominee at the end of March, as they had assumed he would.\n",
            "399: “There’s no closure,” said a top Biden adviser.\n",
            "400: The pandemic exploded and inserted itself as the only issue that matters just as Biden made his remarkable transition from lost cause to incredible comeback.\n",
            "401: The rebound was so swift and his dominance over the race so sudden, that a lot of Biden advisers and outside allies are still processing what happened.\n",
            "402: Did Biden build an excellent team that just took some time to get things right?\n",
            "403: Or was Biden’s team hapless and he was simply the beneficiary of underlying dynamics in the primary that allowed him to beat Sanders?\n",
            "404: “After Super Tuesday, Biden got catapulted to the front of the line in spite of himself and his campaign,” he said.\n",
            "405: Biden clearly agreed that some version of this analysis was accurate: He replaced his campaign manager on March 12, after a string of victories made it clear he would be the nominee.\n",
            "406: The Biden campaign has not quite figured out what will replace the traditional set piece events of a presidential campaign.\n",
            "407: For now, in the teeth of the crisis, when attention is necessarily focused on the people in charge, Biden has two big problems.\n",
            "408: former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden holds a virtual campaign event on March 13 in Chicago.\n",
            "409: “Biden has a thin line,” the outside adviser to Biden said.\n",
            "410: Then there’s the issue of Biden being denied one of his political strengths.\n",
            "411: Biden thrives on personal connection; the pandemic has robbed him of the ability to meet with actual people.\n",
            "412: But we talk about the day, and we hang out,” Biden told Jake Tapper on Tuesday.\n",
            "413: “There are other Democrats who think all of the hand-wringing over Biden’s bizarre situation and the complexities and political downside of creating a virtual campaign are overblown.”\n",
            "414: “We’re thinking through what does a virtual campaign look like, and how do we ensure that Biden is able to have that one-on-one connection that he is able to form with voters when he’s out in the real world,” said Bedingfield.\n",
            "415: Next up, launching on Monday, is a regular podcast that Biden will host with a one-on-one conversation format.\n",
            "416: Biden stumbled to victory with a nearly broke campaign.\n",
            "417: Those twin developments have many Democrats concerned that Biden’s fundraising has dramatically stalled.\n",
            "418: The Biden campaign acknowledged it was a serious concern.\n",
            "419: “We are preparing for and thinking through how we execute the campaign knowing that it’s very possible that fundraising across the board, and not just for our campaign, it’s just gonna be leaner than it might have been a few months ago,” said a Biden adviser.\n",
            "420: But there are other Democrats who think all of the hand-wringing over Biden’s bizarre situation and the complexities and political downside of creating a virtual campaign are overblown.\n",
            "421: Across Europe, the congratulations for U.S. President-elect Joe Biden started flowing within minutes of the race being called, but it was clear that European leaders were also toasting themselves, the end of the Trump era, and the prospect of a renewal of transatlantic relations.\n",
            "422: With President Donald Trump still claiming fraud and refusing to concede, many European leaders cast aside caution and diplomatic protocol to swiftly send their good wishes to Biden, the former vice president and longtime senator who is well known across the Continent.\n",
            "423: “I want to congratulate the new President Elect of the USA Joe Biden,” Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin tweeted at 5:37 p.m. Central European Time, just 15 minutes after CNN became the first news network to project the Democratic nominee had finally won after four days of vote counting.\n",
            "424: “Biden has been a true friend of this nation throughout his life and I look forward to working with him in the years ahead,” Martin wrote.\n",
            "425: In a fuller statement, Martin noted Biden’s Irish family heritage.\n",
            "426: “This is a particularly special day for the people of County Louth and of County Mayo who count President-elect Biden among their own,” he said.\n",
            "427: But it was less the family connection and more Biden’s repeated statements in support of the Good Friday Agreement and, more broadly, U.S. Democrats’ backing of Ireland in the context of Brexit that gave Martin reasons to take the lead among Europeans wishing well to Biden, and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris.\n",
            "428: “While some of the processes are still playing out, it is now clear Joe Biden has won,” Raab tweeted.\n",
            "429: “Congratulations Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\n",
            "430: “I warmly congratulate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for their victory in the U.S. Presidential elections,” Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.\n",

            "432: On this basis the EU congratulates President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on reaching enough Electoral Votes.”\n",
            "433: NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who spent much of the past four years trying to keep Trump on board with the alliance, made clear he expected no such struggle with Biden.\n",
            "434: “I warmly welcome the election of Joe Biden as the next President of the United States,” Stoltenberg said in a statement.\n",
            "435: “I know Mr. Biden as a strong supporter of NATO and the transatlantic relationship.”\n",
            "436: “Things will not just go back where they were.” Still, she pronounced herself as “feelin good” about Biden’s victory.\n",
            "437: As his colleagues congratulated Biden, Janša noted that there was a still a court fight ahead, and that it was the mainstream media, not election officials, who had declared the winner.\n",
            "438: U.S. Vice President Joe Biden is leaving his options open for 2020.\n",
            "439: After presiding over the Senate Tuesday, where a cancer-treatment bill was renamed to honor his late son Beau, Biden spoke to reporters about his final days in the Senate before saying he was “going to run again.”\n",
            "440: Biden was asked if he was kidding about running.\n",
            "441: I learned a long time ago fate has a strange way of intervening,” Biden said.\n",
            "442: Biden considered running for president this year, but decided against it after Beau died from cancer in May 2015.\n",
            "443: European Council President Charles Michel will invite U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to participate in a videoconference with EU heads of state and government, perhaps even before the January 20 inauguration, a senior EU official said Tuesday.\n",
            "444: Michel’s willingness to put aside formalities reflects just how thrilled most European leaders are about Biden’s victory and the prospect of renewing transatlantic relations, which frayed badly during the Trump years.\n",
            "445: Biden has pledged to rejoin the Paris climate accords, reversing a Trump decision from early in his term that had left many EU leaders deeply distressed.\n",
            "446: European leaders are also hoping that Biden will help renegotiate the Iran nuclear agreement, restore comity to trade relations, and generally reintroduce a level of civility in the discourse that has been absent in the years since Trump declared the EU a “foe” that had long taken advantage of the U.S.\n",
            "447: On Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she looked forward to working with Biden and recalled good interactions with him when he served as vice president.\n",
            "448: Word of Michel’s planned invitation came as Biden made an initial round of calls to European leaders.\n",
            "449: More than a year after the controversial U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell resigned his post, the German news magazine Der Spiegel has reported that U.S. President Joe Biden plans to nominate Amy Gutmann, president of the University of Pennsylvania, for the role.\n",
            "450: Still, she brings some experience in politics — she served as head of former President Barack Obama’s Bioethics Commission — and has come into frequent contact with Biden via his close ties to Penn.\n",
            "451: While vice president under Obama, Biden kicked off his 2016 “Cancer Moonshot” program at Penn’s Abramson Cancer Center, and accepted an honorary professorship post at the university after leaving the White House in 2017.\n",
            "452: Biden also helped found the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, D.C., in 2018.\n",
            "453: Officials on both sides have been eager to repair relations since Biden took over, even as a handful of significant policy differences remain.\n",
            "454: On a swing through Europe last month, the first international trip of his presidency, Biden underscored his commitment to U.S. re-engagement on the global stage.\n",
            "455: Still, Biden’s presidency hasn’t returned things to their pre-Trump normal: Germany remains wary of relying on the U.S. as a long-term strategic partner, advocating for the European Union to take a more active role in charting its own future.\n",
            "456: Nominating a well-established academic like Gutmann — particularly one who has extensive expertise on democracy issues — sends a signal that Biden is serious about his stated focus on shoring up democracies around the world.\n",
            "457: At the same time, she added, “I think the Biden administration wants to know where Germany stands … This balancing act, which has happened for quite a long time now, is not sustainable.”\n",
            "458: But Joe Biden’s brief visit to Northern Ireland across Tuesday night and Wednesday — 18 hours total, about half of them in bed — featured none of the gaffes that have previously blotted his diplomatic copybook.\n",
            "459: Wednesday’s gathering at Ulster University in Belfast brought Northern Ireland’s opposing political leaders — including the key figure blocking the revival of power-sharing, Democratic Unionist chief Jeffrey Donaldson — side by side at last, along with a selfie-shooting Biden.\n",
            "460: And instead of extolling his famous Irish Catholic roots, Biden’s speech noted the English and Protestant elements of his family tree, and the disproportionate contribution of Ulster Scots immigrants to the foundation of the United States.\n",
            "461: “The family ties, the pride, those Ulster Scots immigrants who helped found and build my country, they run very deep,” Biden told the audience.\n",
            "462: If Biden had punches to throw in the Democratic Unionists’ direction, he pulled them.\n",
            "463: Speaking to POLITICO, a visibly relieved Donaldson said afterward that he’d appreciated the president’s “measured and balanced remarks” — and distanced himself from his unionist colleagues’ pointed criticisms of Biden as a poodle to Irish nationalism and even the outlawed IRA.\n",
            "464: He also rebuffed a claim by his predecessor as DUP leader, Arlene Foster, that Biden “hates the United Kingdom,” stating: “The United Kingdom and the United States have a strong alliance and we want to build on that.”\n",
            "465: He noted that Biden’s speech diplomatically avoided assigning blame for the Stormont impasse and focused on making a better Northern Ireland for today’s Ulster University students, who are too young to remember the three decades of bloodshed that ended following paramilitary cease-fires in the mid-1990s.\n",
            "466: But Murphy added: “Biden’s pitch is about the future.\n",
            "467: Most of those present agreed that, even though some leaders had wanted Biden to visit the Stormont parliament building overlooking Belfast, the president’s decision not to do so meant their failure to form a new government hadn’t become the central image of the visit.\n",
            "468: The assembly’s caretaker speaker, Alex Maskey, also from Sinn Féin, agreed that in hindsight, Biden was probably right to have declined his own invitation to visit what is essentially Ground Zero of Northern Ireland’s political dysfunction.\n",
            "469: While Biden strikingly spent less than a day in Belfast before crossing the border to spend the rest of the week touring the Republic of Ireland, he left behind his new envoy to Northern Ireland, Joe Kennedy III, who will spend the next 10 days building business and political contacts across the U.K. region.\n",
            "470: Kennedy insisted Biden hadn’t needed to spend too much time in Belfast talking to local leaders this week — because he’d just had all of them, including Donaldson, as guests to the White House for St. Patrick’s Day.\n",
            "471: Even by the shameless standard of attempting to claim every American president as Irish, Joe Biden’s April 2023 visit to Ireland was remarkable — not because of the U.S. president’s genuine affection for the land of his great-great-grandfather, but because the three-day agenda read more like a prolonged family bonding retreat than a serious attempt at forging deeper transatlantic ties.\n",
            "472: In reality, Biden’s view of Ireland — mired in his ancestors’ escape from poverty, washed down with a heady dose of prose and poetry — represents an increasingly distant part of Irish-American folklore.\n",
            "473: The issue here isn’t about diluting Ireland’s links to the U.S., or forgetting the importance of Irish America — as Biden well knows, shared history is a cultural centerpiece of identity.\n",
            "474: It’s why Biden must be the last Irish-American president.\n",
            "475: WASHINGTON — EU leaders in Washington for a summit with U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday had an important objective: projecting a united front after days of mixed messages on the Israel crisis.\n",
            "476: European Council President Charles Michel, who is visiting the White House for the first time, will hold a bilateral meeting with Biden in the Oval Office ahead of the EU-U.S. summit.\n",
            "477: Though Michel is formally charged with representing the EU on the global stage, it is von der Leyen who has the deeper relationship with the Biden administration, a link solidified during the run-up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 when the Commission chief and her team worked closely with the White House on coordinating sanctions.\n",
            "478: She has met Biden several times.\n",
            "479: Michel previously took issue with von der Leyen’s stance on China, amid suspicions that the EU’s executive was overly swayed by the position of the Biden administration.\n",
            "480: Biden is set to reverse Trump’s withdrawal from the WHO, but in the meantime, Europe has stepped up to the plate.\n",
            "481: U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rescind his country's planned withdrawal from the WHO on his first day in office, but his predecessor has left him a vastly changed political space.\n",
            "482: Trump meanwhile, has refused to join COVAX and Biden's team is expected to hold talks with the alliance.\n",
            "483: Biden has made clear his commitment to global health and the WHO, tweeting in July: “Americans are safer when America is engaged in strengthening global health.\n",
            "484: His campaign website states that he will call for “fully resourcing the WHO, especially its Contingency Fund for Emergencies.” But in the four years that Biden has been out of the White House, much work on global health has been undone.\n",
            "485: It’s expected that Biden will repeal the policy once he is in office — a move welcomed by many working in global health.\n",
            "486: The financing of global health will be one of Biden’s first challenges, said Kickbusch.\n",
            "487: Kickbusch said that it isn’t clear how Biden will address this, nor how he will go about future funding of the WHO.\n",
            "488: A Biden presidency could pave the way for strengthened relations between the EU and the U.S., with global health issues set to continue to dominate the headlines for months to come.\n",
            "489: U.S. President Joe Biden “absolutely” supports European allies developing their own, stronger military capabilities — but it’s high time for EU leaders to move beyond theory and rhetoric, State Department Counselor Derek Chollet told POLITICO on a visit to Brussels.\n",
            "490: The push for increased European military prowess, often called “strategic autonomy,” got a boost from Biden this fall after his administration infuriated France by announcing a surprise Indo-Pacific security partnership with the U.K. and Australia.\n",
            "491: As part of his effort to patch up relations with French President Emmanuel Macron, Biden agreed to support a raft of joint security and defense initiatives, which they discussed on the sidelines of the recent G20 summit in Rome and detailed in a joint statement.\n",
            "492: His trip to the Bosnian capital coincided with the 26th anniversary of the Dayton signing, and Chollet said he carried a “pretty stern message” from the Biden administration, warning the country’s leaders against provocative language, including some suggesting a breakup of the country.\n",
            "493: Chollet noted that numerous U.S. officials, including Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, had spent time earlier in their careers working to help bring peace to the former Yugoslavia.\n",
            "494: But if Chollet is a veritable in-house scribe of State Department history, he noted the unhappy precedent of having so few of Biden’s ambassadors confirmed by the Senate, partly the result of a Republican blocking campaign, and fueled by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.\n",
            "495: In the interview, Chollet described the backlog in ambassador confirmations as evidence of the larger political polarization and gridlock that has gripped the U.S. in recent years and worsened during the four years of Donald Trump’s presidency, which he said created “a lot of uncertainty and guessing about where the U.S. is headed.” Biden, he argued, has “tried to spend the first 10 months resetting a bit.”\n",
            "496: Chollet said that Biden, like former President Barack Obama, was wrestling with an ever-more complicated, multipolar global system and trying to repair the damage at home and abroad: “Now, we’ve got the rise of China, we had a pandemic, and that we’re still struggling with, of course, and deeper domestic dysfunction in the United States.”\n",
            "497: And Biden must give attention to that dysfunction, he said.\n",
            "498: A split is emerging at the very top of the European Union over the bloc’s China policy, amid growing pressure from U.S. President Joe Biden for Brussels to take a more hawkish stance toward Beijing.\n",
            "499: Senior figures in the European Council — including President Charles Michel — are pushing for a less confrontational approach to China than that of the Biden administration, which is trying to pressure allies to team up in taking on Beijing.\n",
            "500: In particular, there is concern within the European Council about the joint statement issued by von der Leyen and Biden following their meeting in the White House last Friday.\n",
            "501: But the U.S. has indicated that Biden won’t attend a summit in Europe before June — a sequence of events that will delay the next EU-China summit until the second half of the year.\n",
            "502: Von der Leyen herself has struck up a strong professional relationship with Biden.\n",
            "503: Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel was also reluctant to toe the line on U.S. policy regarding China — infuriating Sullivan and incoming members of the Biden administration during the transition period between the Trump and Biden presidencies, when she helped drive an EU trade pact with China in December 2020.\n",
            "504: LONDON — If the first weeks of 2021 are anything to go by, the United States under Joe Biden will present a wholly different face to the world.\n",
            "505: Still, Biden’s priorities are becoming clearer.\n",
            "506: Biden is “very focused” on addressing climate change, he pointed out, “as is Boris Johnson” with Britain's hosting of the COP26 climate conference in November.\n",
            "507: “The U.S., under President Biden, is likely to introduce a tariff regime that encourages sustainable trade,” said Rebecca Harding, chief executive of Coriolis Technologies.\n",
            "508: And it is worth watching “what the Biden administration does on carbon border taxes,” said Tim Figures, a senior expert on geopolitics and trade at the Boston Consulting Group, late last year.\n",
            "509: Such rifts could potentially dilute the West’s response, and Holmes said a top priority for Biden “will be the desire to mend fences with the EU and to find a better way to respond to China.\" Is there a way for the U.K. to play a diplomatic role in between?\n",
            "510: On Wednesday Britain’s trade secretary Liz Truss clearly echoed Biden as she called for an alliance of free-trading democracies — including the United States and Japan — to protect global trading rules.\n",
            "511: If the U.K. can turn its gaze from Brexit, Holmes said, “we will need to respond to the Biden trade agenda.” Trade agreements will be at the bottom of the new president's priorities, he added, and “a separate trade deal with the U.K. will be relatively unimportant.”\n",
            "512: But Biden’s trade team led by U.S. Trade Representative nominee Katherine Tai will still need to get into position.\n",
            "513: The U.K. is working to entice the Biden administration back to the table by promising to go further on the deal’s sustainability provisions.\n",
            "514: Yet dealing with the domestic economic aftermath of COVID-19 and all the other burning issues left by the Trump administration will cause the deal to “fall down the political agenda,” said Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, shortly after Biden’s election.\n",
            "515: In an early move, Biden and Tai may “roll back some of the Trump tariffs,” said Dan Griswold, a senior trade research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center, a free-market think tank.\n",
            "516: Truss repeatedly raised the issue in U.K.-U.S. trade negotiations with Lighthizer — and Britain now looks to the Biden administration for the next move.\n",
            "517: “We are so lucky to have the European Union as a partner in what we do,” U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who personally delivered the late-May Valentine on behalf of President Joe Biden, said Wednesday evening.\n",
            "518: EU leaders, officials and diplomats are generally thrilled to have Biden in office instead of Donald Trump.\n",
            "519: But some have complained that the U.S. is also back to its friendly exceptionalism, occasionally taking decisions with minimal or no consultation, such as Biden’s unexpected support for lifting patent protections for coronavirus vaccines.\n",
            "520: But she also praised the quick action by Brussels and noted Biden had applauded it and intended to follow up with U.S. measures.\n",
            "521: Liz Truss predicted Joe Biden will never do a trade deal with the United Kingdom.\n",
            "522: Truss told the Heritage Foundation think tank in Washington D.C.: \"There will not be a U.S.-U.K. trade deal under Joe Biden.\n",
            "523: Speaking Monday, she contrasted Biden's attitude to a deal with his predecessor Donald Trump, who she's rowing in behind in November's U.S. presidential election.\n",
            "524: Biden's administration shelved separated plans for a more limited, \"foundational\" trade agreement last December after Senate opposition and disagreements over the deal's scope.\n",
            "525: European diplomats and officials have described their shock at President Joe Biden’s faltering, error-strewn public performances and revealed they have already started reaching out to Donald Trump.\n",
            "526: With his poll numbers in decline, Biden is under mounting pressure from his own supporters to step aside in favor of a younger candidate like Vice President Kamala Harris to take on Trump at November’s presidential election.\n",
            "527: First, there was Biden’s stumble at the presidential TV debate last month, in which he lost his train of thought, triggering a wave of soul-searching among Democrats and others who worry what a new Trump term will bring.\n",
            "528: Then, on Thursday, came Biden’s long press conference at the close of the NATO summit in Washington, during which he insisted he was fit enough to serve another term and the best person to beat Trump.\n",
            "529: When Biden introduced Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy as “President Putin,” there was an audible gasp among Europeans in the room.\n",
            "530: Nobody mentioned it with the Biden team afterward.”\n",
            "531: The Trump outreach has accelerated, another diplomat said, and predates Biden’s latest gaffes.\n",
            "532: The NATO summit marked the first meeting of Biden and new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to reaffirm the so-called “special relationship” between the United Kingdom and the United States.\n",
            "533: “It is now clear that Joe Biden sticking to his candidacy will only help Trump,” said Roderich Kiesewetter, a prominent Christian Democrat lawmaker on the Foreign Affairs Committee in Berlin.\n",
            "534: “It can only be hoped that the Democrats will find a way for Joe Biden to withdraw while saving face and that Kamala Harris, for example, will become the Democrats’ frontrunner.”\n",
            "535: But look closer, and it turns out that on everything from trade and taxes to coronavirus vaccines, U.S. President Joe Biden is transpiring to be every inch as much of a pain in Brussels' bureaucratic backside as his predecessor — hitting the EU exactly where it hurts, while robbing it of the moral high ground it loves to occupy.\n",
            "536: Biden's bombshell proposal to waive intellectual property rights on coronavirus vaccines is a perfect case in point, as the EU is now floundering in the PR war, all too conscious that it has suddenly been turned into a cartoon villain, advocating the rights of Big Pharma against poor nations.\n",
            "537: \"The real change is that the Biden administration, to our biggest astonishment also including mine, is really changing the overall narrative on these issues, which we didn't think he would,\" said Kathleen Van Brempt, a Belgian member of the European Parliament and the Socialist group's point person on trade.\n",
            "538: In only a few months, Biden has exposed both the folly in the EU's trade policy toward China and Europe's lack of ambition in plans to tax digital multinationals.\n",
            "539: Infuriatingly for the Europeans, while the superficial political optics have improved, Biden's turning out to be just as hard as Trump on issues the EU really cares about, like Germany's plans to buy gas from Russia through the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.\n",
            "540: While Biden has moved to defuse a long-standing tariff clash over subsidies for Airbus and Boeing, the new president has also left much of Trump's trade policy untouched, including tariffs on steel and a blockade of the World Trade Organization's court system.\n",
            "541: Biden's drive for a \"Buy American\" policy, favoring U.S. companies in major public tenders, is even drawing countermeasures from the EU camp.\n",
            "542: Biden's surprise move to publicly back India and South Africa's call for a waiver on the intellectual property of coronavirus vaccines was just the latest example in a set of maverick moves that not only run counter to the EU's economic interests, but that — unlike Trump — also called the bluff of Brussels' supposedly progressive leadership.\n",
            "543: In a sign that even France, which officially backed the IP waiver, was not amused by the Biden administration's volte-face, Junior Europe Minister Clément Beaune told POLITICO that it was a \"very political move, because so far they have exported nothing\" in terms of vaccines.\n",
            "544: But Van Brempt from the European Parliament pointed out that Biden had exposed Brussels' failure to act.\n",
            "545: China has been another highly strategic area where the U.S. has made the EU look hypocritical for pontificating about \"European values.\" Led by Germany and its all-important car industry, the EU rushed into a trade deal with Beijing at the end of last year, brushing off concerns about human rights and requests from the incoming Biden administration to consult on the agreement.\n",
            "546: While it was Trump's Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who first labeled China's persecutions of Uyghurs in Xinjiang a \"genocide,\" the Biden administration doubled down by formalizing the designation in a report — piling moral pressure on EU countries to also take a stand, and turning the eyes of the world to German carmaker Volkswagen's factory in the region.\n",
            "547: As with the steel tariffs and WTO blockage, Biden has kept the stick and largely continued Trump's policies.\n",
            "548: But, unlike Trump, Biden is simultaneously winning the moral high ground.\n",
            "549: In another curveball move last month, Biden blindsided EU leaders.\n",
            "550: Biden's plan to tax the 100 largest companies in the world would include the likes of Google and Facebook, but also non-digital giants such as Volkswagen and French oil and gas giant Total.\n",
            "551: \"My impression is that also our French friends in Paris are very much impressed [by Biden's tax initiative] and will give him a chance,” Altmaier said diplomatically.\n",
            "552: Van Brempt from the Socialists said all these moves from Biden ramped up pressure on the EU to become more coherent.\n",
            "553: U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Friday called on President Donald Trump to make public a July phone call at the center of a report that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to find dirt on Biden’s family.\n",
            "554: “If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country,” Biden said in a statement.\n",
            "555: Biden’s comments come after a report that Trump pressured Ukrainian officials to investigate a potential political opponent — a call that reportedly prompted a whistleblower complaint by a member of the intelligence community that has been stonewalled from congressional review.\n",
            "556: Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani admitted Thursday evening to asking Ukraine to investigate Biden during a rambling — and at times contradictory — interview, having previously claimed that Biden as vice president tried to shield his son Hunter from investigation over ties with a Ukrainian gas company.\n",
            "557: Biden has denied those allegations.\n",
            "558: Trump said the contents of his phone call with the Ukrainian president were “totally appropriate,” but did not answer whether he asked to investigate Biden, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the nature of the phone call.\n",
            "559: Biden, but his state media agents of chaos sprung into action.\n",
            "560: Russian President Vladimir Putin enjoyed a lie-in on Friday instead of watching the debate between U.S. President Joe Biden and Republican challenger Donald Trump.\n",
            "561: Biden’s halting performance alarmed allies and triggered calls from Democrats that he should pull out of the election race.\n",
            "562: State news agency RIA published a tally of how often the two candidates mentioned the name “Vladimir Putin” (seven times for both) and Russia (Trump: 16, Biden: 0).\n",
            "563: Russian media also zeroed in on Biden’s comments that the Kremlin would not limit itself to conquering Ukraine and wanted to “re-establish what was part of the Soviet Empire,” and his description of Putin as a “war criminal.”\n",
            "564: “Biden expectedly misspoke multiple times and stammered, Democrats have already called his performance a failure,” state news agency RIA concluded, leaving Trump out of its crosshairs altogether.\n",
            "565: Several Russian media outlets also ran separate stories on Trump’s statement that “Ukraine’s not winning that war” and suffering heavy losses — a message that will be well received by many Russians — because of Biden “and his stupid decisions.”\n",
            "566: Putin has said in the past that he prefers Biden to Trump because he’s “more experienced, more predictable” — but whether that’s a real endorsement for the man who called Putin a “killer” is questionable.\n",
            "567: He has pledged to unleash fossil fuel production to lower energy costs and to walk away from President Joe Biden’s clean energy subsidy regime, which was designed to stimulate a clean industrial boom.\n",
            "568: A Joe Biden victory in the U.S. presidential election would not mean Europe could rely on America for security as it used to do, Germany’s defense minister said Wednesday.\n",
            "569: “Even if Joe Biden wins — which would mean we would certainly deal with each other in a different way — we must not forget that there are certain views that are shared by a large part of the American political class, for example on China or how to deal with Russia, where I would mention Nord Stream 2,” Kramp-Karrenbauer said, referring to the controversial gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany.\n",

            "575: “The United States of America, did not, did not, have any foreknowledge of what befell you on July 15,” Biden said, calling the coup attempt “a cowardly act” and a “treacherous act” on the part of a group within “your military.”\n",

            "584: Biden’s U.S. presidential campaign-in-waiting has ramped up over the last several weeks — calling donors across the country and tapping decades-old friendships to line up support from major Democratic Party figures, organized labor, members of Congress and elected officials from early presidential states, according to people with direct knowledge of Biden’s campaign strategy.\n",
            "585: POLITICO also spoke to donors who’ve received calls from Biden’s team, potential campaign aides who have been interviewed for jobs and stakeholders in early primary and caucus states who were asked to pitch in their support.\n",
            "586: As Biden seeks on-the-ground labor support in early primary and caucus states, he has all but locked in the endorsement of the International Association of Firefighters, the union that helped boost John Kerry to the Democratic nomination in 2004.\n",
            "587: This year, union President Harold Schaitberger said, the 315,000-member union plans to quickly deploy an organized effort to boost Biden in the early-voting states.\n",
            "588: Once Biden’s announcement goes live, Schaitberger continued, “our executive board will be prepared to immediately meet and formally take a position on the primary and we’ll likely be prepared to make that announcement on the 29th.”\n",
            "589: As Biden’s team works to lock down national labor support, it is also chasing union backing in early states like Iowa, where his aides have already interviewed staff.\n",
            "590: The early activity is fueled by Biden’s long relationships within the Democratic Party and the bonds he built as Barack Obama’s vice president, which vaulted him to the top of the primary pack this year without rushing into the race early.\n",
            "591: But Biden’s team sees an opportunity to generate something Biden hasn’t yet had this year with a strong entrance: forward momentum, created by proving he has what it takes to compete in a historically large primary field before going toe-to-toe with President Donald Trump.\n",
            "592: Asked if she will be with Biden: “100 percent.\n",

            "603: Stephen Cozen, an attorney and longtime Biden ally, said the fundraising effort aims “to demonstrate to others that he’s got this very broad band of support at the lowest level, not necessarily even at the highest level, where I’m sure — I know for a fact — there are people with a lot of money sitting out there waiting for Joe to get in.\n",
            "604: Biden’s call for donors comes as he’s expected to be outpaced on small-donor fundraising by others in the field, including Senator Bernie Sanders, who so far has the most consistent, highest polling aside from Biden.\n",

            "659: Biden’s move got wider European support.\n",
            "660: Just as Joe Biden is insisting the U.S. government should \"Buy American,\" Europe is on the verge of rolling out a countermeasure that will heap pressure on EU member countries to \"Buy European.\"\n",

            "668: The U.K. government will have far more alignment on foreign policy matters with a Biden administration, but many observers have predicted a cool relationship between Johnson — the figurehead of Brexit — and the president-elect, who opposed the U.K.’s departure from the EU and as recently as December described Johnson (whom he has not met) as “a physical and emotional clone” of Trump.\n",
            "669: A key area of convergence could be climate change diplomacy, with Biden vowing to bring the U.S. back into the Paris climate agreement on his first day in office and to put the country on the path to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and with Johnson due to host the COP26 UN climate summit in Glasgow in November 2021.\n",

            "685: In his speech in Munich, Biden called for a reform of NATO to meet threats unique to the 21st century and promised “serious coordination and consensus-building.” In recent speeches and articles, he has vowed to return on “day one” of his presidency to the Paris accord on fighting climate change and to the World Health Organization.\n",
            "686: But while a Democratic administration in Washington can be expected to consult allies more, be more active diplomatically and be more supportive of international institutions, a Biden presidency will not mark a return to the post-World War II era in which Europe could afford to live comfortably under the American umbrella.\n",

            "718: Following reports that President Donald Trump pressured Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden’s son, Hunter Biden — which led to a whistleblower complaint and stalled congressional review — Pompeo joined many Trump allies in pivoting the conversation to discrediting the Democratic 2020 front-runner.\n",
            "719: Biden has been attacked by those who say that while he was vice president, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid from Ukraine and called for the firing of a state prosecutor looking into a gas company where Hunter Biden held a board position.\n",
            "720: Trump himself has doubled down on these claims against Biden.\n",
            "721: “If Vice President Biden behaved inappropriately, if he was protecting his son and intervened with the Ukrainian leadership in a way that was corrupt, I do think we need to get to the bottom of that,” Pompeo said on ABC’s “This Week.“\n",

            "726: The report, obtained by POLITICO in advance of its release on Wednesday, urges President Joe Biden to encourage the EU to develop hard-power military capabilities and calls on him to abandon decades of opposition to EU defense integration by previous U.S. leaders, under the guise of preventing wasteful duplication with NATO — which remains orthodox thinking for most American military commanders, and even for many EU governments.\n",
            "727: The report, published just 10 days before Biden makes his first trip abroad as president for G7 and NATO summits, calls out Washington for hounding European allies to spend more on their militaries to reach NATO’s 2 percent of GDP spending target, while preventing the EU from pursuing initiatives that would save money and improve fighting readiness.\n",
            "728: The report is likely to generate attention in part because the Center for American Progress has become known as a training ground for Biden administration officials, with dozens of the think tank’s alumni now in positions at the White House, the State Department, the Pentagon and other government agencies.\n",
            "729: The think tank’s former president and chief executive, Neera Tanden, recently joined the White House as a senior adviser to Biden, a role that might make her even more powerful than budget director, the post for which she was initially nominated but withdrew when it became clear she could not win Senate confirmation.\n",

            "784: They’d sent it to Biden’s advisers — Ricchetti, the preparer of all the plans; Mike Donilon, his longtime political consultant and the chief agitator for a run; Ted Kaufman, his best friend and former chief of staff; and his son Hunter, who was also talking through a run with supporters.\n",

            "860: Obama seemed confident enough that Biden would skip the race to go short of endorsing Clinton outright, and now people who know the president acknowledge just how tough it would be for him to tell a man he truly considers a brother to follow his heart without giving his own realistic assessment of the height of the mountain he’d have to climb.\n",
            "861: Add to that the Biden world’s apparent expectation that Obama would be supportive, Obama’s own genuine affection for Clinton and the president having to spend the next eight months tiptoeing around implying either one of them is ahead in the battle for his legacy, and it gets even tougher.\n",

            "877: While the Airbus-Boeing dispute is a long-running sore, Biden's more imminent problem is that there is another hefty tranche of EU duties coming.\n",
            "878: While both the EU and U.S. have said they would like to avoid that escalation, there is no immediate way out of this crunch because Biden faces internal pressure from steelmakers, unions and some parts of his party to maintain the steel tariffs.\n",
            "879: Biden's challenge is that removing Trump's steel tariffs would open him up to accusations from industry and unions that he is weaker on trade enforcement than Republicans.\n",
            "880: One reason Biden defeated Trump in November was that he won back some of the blue-collar voters who abandoned Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n",
            "881: Similarly, in Brussels, there is little appetite to stop the tariff hike unless Biden removes the tariffs.\n",
            "882: And I think what President Biden has said is we’re going to have a whole of government review of all of these policies and decide what it makes sense to maintain.”\n",
            "883: Biden's nominee for U.S. trade representative, Katherine Tai, said last week that while she understood the pain coming her country's way in June, she also understood the need to maintain a strong U.S. steel industry.\n",

            "919: After the trauma of the Trump years, many European decision-makers will see the Biden presidency as a golden opportunity not just to repair the transatlantic alliance but to renew and redefine it for the coming decades.\n",
            "920: Not that Biden would be an easy partner.\n",
            "921: Whatever his sympathies for Europe, Biden, like Barack Obama before him, will make it clear that the Europeans need to stop talking and start doing if they want an equal partnership with the U.S. and help avoid a return to Trumpism four years from now.\n",
            "922: Here’s what a Biden reset with Europe might look like across a range of issues.\n",
            "923: While that tone will get friendlier, the Biden administration is unlikely to return to the status quo ante overnight.\n",
            "924: That means that while it might be easier to seal a trade arrangement with the Biden administration, it won’t be an easy negotiation, especially considering that the U.S. trade deficit with Europe has ballooned to over $170 billion.\n",
            "925: That said, Biden could open the door to renewing a transatlantic free trade agreement.\n",
            "926: Biden’s victory came too late to stop the U.S. from leaving the Paris climate deal, but that doesn’t mean that he can’t reenter it as soon as he takes office.\n",
            "927: It’s an issue that Biden has made clear he takes seriously, going as far as to signal during the campaign that he sees the U.S. phasing out its reliance on oil and gas over the long term.\n",

            "931: Bottom line: In the face of growing public unease over China’s crackdown in Hong Kong and its use of concentration camps to intimidate its Muslim population, Biden’s Washington is likely to prevail.\n",
            "932: The pledge NATO countries made in 2014 to move toward spending 2 percent of GDP on defense will remain on the agenda under Biden — even if he’s bound to be less nasty than Trump was about reminding Europeans that many countries (chiefly Germany) haven’t been pulling their weight.\n",
            "933: Biden will also make clear that with the U.S. shifting its attention to China, Europe is going to have to lead the effort on the Continent to counter Russian and Chinese attempts to establish a foothold.\n",
            "934: While Biden has been vocal in stressing the necessity of confronting Russian aggression, he sees China as the long-term threat.\n",
            "935: That could make it more difficult for Biden to flip a switch to reverse Trump’s decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal, especially if doing so threatened the recent improvement.\n",
            "936: While the EU, which regards the deal as one of its great diplomatic achievements, has clung to the pact and is anticipating a U.S. return under Biden, it could be a tough sell in the U.S., even among Democrats.\n",
            "937: Bottom line: Biden will probably attempt some form of rapprochement with Iran, but a full return to the nuclear deal is unlikely.\n",
            "938: Behind the scenes, the Biden administration was urging Benjamin Netanyahu to delay launching the offensive — a bid to run the clock, hoping the passing of time might lead Israel to scale back its military plans.\n",
            "939: Characteristically, U.S. President Joe Biden has been inconsistent, trying to have it all ways.\n",
            "940: Two weeks ago, when asked what the chances were for a cease-fire in Gaza, Biden was in warrior mode and dismissive.\n",
            "941: But less than a week later, while in Nantucket, Massachusetts for Thanksgiving, that was all forgotten and Biden struck a different chord saying “the chances are real” that the pause could open the door to a longer cease-fire.\n",
            "942: Admittedly, Biden hasn’t talked yet of a permanent cease-fire and he’s linked any truces to the release of hostages.\n",
            "943: But the change in the mood music was striking and has been noted in Israel, where there’s rising anxiety that the Biden administration is making electoral calculations swayed by progressive Democrats, Arab leaders and Europeans.\n",
            "944: Politicians across the ideological spectrum in Israel are always careful to praise Biden publicly, but most are suspicious of the U.S. president, noting his inconstancy and his long-established pattern to talk grandiosely but act cautiously.\n",
            "945: In fact, the quip doing the rounds in Tel Aviv is that “Biden is your best friend, until he isn’t.”\n",
            "946: Joe Biden’s problem is they’re weak.\n",
            "947: Even with Biden robustly proclaiming his commitment to NATO, the harsh reality of Europe’s unreadiness could create tensions within the alliance that are even more difficult to smooth over than Trump’s badgering of allies to increase their military spending — something they had all pledged to do at a leaders’ summit in Wales in 2014.\n",
            "948: In recent days, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has sought to assure the Biden administration that he shares the priority being placed on China, just as he repeatedly sought to assure Trump he was pressing for more spending.\n",
            "949: Stoltenberg has also stressed that China should be brought into discussions on nuclear arms control, echoing a view widely held among Biden’s security team.\n",
            "950: “Biden has been much more eloquent, much more diplomatic than Trump has, but the threat perception is so vastly different that I see a huge problem for NATO’s cohesion to be emerging.\n",
            "951: But even if all allies came around to the U.S. point of view on China, claiming consensus with Biden is cheap and easy compared to preparing European militaries for faraway missions.\n",
            "952: Instead, they rely on the U.S. for security and are now preparing to exit Afghanistan by September 11, a deadline set by Biden, even as some allies fear what will happen in the country when they leave.\n",
            "953: Some allies don’t share Biden’s perception of China as a military threat.\n",
            "954: Biden, at his own news conference, emphasized his support for NATO.\n",
            "955: Biden noted that the only time Article 5 had been invoked was after the September 11 terror attacks on the U.S. — a point Stoltenberg and European allies often reiterate.\n",
            "956: But some seem to worry that Biden will be too soft on the alliance — including Macron, who has pushed for better political cohesion among allies, and also demanded recognition of Europe’s broader efforts to develop so-called strategic autonomy, the push to build up capabilities on the Continent.\n",
            "957: The report said Biden should instead encourage European military integration, pushing allies to cooperate so they can do more to protect themselves, rather than just pressing them to spend more on their individual national forces, which creates waste and inefficiencies.\n",
            "958: While negotiations on the new body are still ongoing, U.S. President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen plan to announce details of the project when they meet in Brussels on June 15.\n",
            "959: Biden and his EU counterparts \"will focus on aligning our approaches to trade and technology so that democracies and not anyone else, not China or other autocracies, are writing the rules for trade and technology for the 21st century,\" Jake Sullivan, the White House's national security adviser, told reporters this week.\n",
            "960: In a round of phone calls with leaders in Brussels, U.S. President-elect Joe Biden spoke Monday with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel, who extended congratulations for his victory over Donald Trump.\n",
            "961: Michel invited Biden to Brussels to attend a meeting with EU heads of state and government.\n",
            "962: Biden also spoke to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.\n",
            "963: “Great to speak with President-elect @JoeBiden,” von der Leyen tweeted after their phone conversation.\n",

            "965: He welcomed the strong commitment of the President-elect Biden to America’s allies and his support for European cooperation.”\n",
            "966: He also invited Biden to meet with the EU’s 27 heads of state and government in Brussels next year, and urged renewed cooperation in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, pushing for economic recovery, combatting climate change and promoting security and multilateralism.\n",
            "967: During their conversation, Michel specifically thanked Biden for joining with other U.S. officials, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in standing with Ireland to insist that the U.K. fully implement the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.\n",
            "968: Stoltenberg said he had also offered congratulations and told Biden he looked forward to planning the next NATO leaders’ summit in 2021.\n",
            "969: And with Joe Biden officially launching his re-election campaign last week, the U.S. president is now one step closer to facing voters within months of his EU counterpart, Ursula von der Leyen, who is still deciding whether to seek her own second term atop the European Commission.\n",
            "970: A defeated Biden could mean a return of Donald Trump, who as president launched a trade war with Europe, openly questioned multilateralism and cast the European Union as a foe.\n",
            "971: And a departing von der Leyen would deprive a re-elected Biden of a resolute EU ally on touchy subjects like sanctioning Russia and keeping China at bay.\n",
            "972: “We are fortunate to have European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President Biden where they are today,” Representative Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told POLITICO.\n",
            "973: The arrival of Biden, a committed transatlanticist, to the White House in 2021 was greeted with barely-contained relief in Brussels.\n",
            "974: The EU was still reeling from the roller-coaster Trump years and it seemed inevitable that things could only get better with the pro-EU Biden in the White House.\n",
            "975: “Part of that is down to the strong relationship between Biden and von der Leyen, which has allowed the sides to manage through any challenges in the relationship.”\n",
            "976: Part of this is due to a meeting of minds between von der Leyen, the 64-year-old former German defense minister, and Biden the 46th U.S. president, who was intimately acquainted with Ukraine policy following his stint as vice president during the Obama administration.\n",
            "977: At a critical Oval Office meeting in November of that year, Biden, who had just come from a briefing by national security and intelligence officials about the buildup of Russian battalions near the Ukraine border, sounded the alarm to von der Leyen.\n",
            "978: Similarly, a plan to remove Trump-era steel and aluminum tariffs on the EU still remains unresolved more than two years into the Biden presidency.\n",
            "979: But the biggest strain on relations was Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.\n",
            "980: Von der Leyen’s perceived closeness to Biden has ruffled some feathers.\n",
            "981: For Gardner, the former U.S. ambassador, it is von der Leyen’s position on China that is one of the closest indications of the strength of the relationship between the Biden administration and the European Commission.\n",
            "982: As the United States sounds the warning bell about Beijing’s geopolitical ambitions, particularly when it comes to Taiwan, Biden may discover he needs that supportive voice on China that von der Leyen offers.\n",
            "983: Given the resistance by some EU figures — not least Macron — to America’s world-view in Asia, Biden may need all the support he can get.\n",
            "984: That’s the simple rule for European power players looking for entrée to the new U.S. presidential administration should Joe Biden win the election on Tuesday.\n",
            "985: is Anthony Gardner, the former U.S. ambassador to the EU, who is now based in London and has served as the Biden campaign’s point-main in Europe.\n",

            "987: The two Tonys are emblematic of the resuscitation and return of the traditional U.S. foreign policy establishment that is expected if Biden becomes president.\n",
            "988: Blinken is much-discussed as likely to become Biden’s national security adviser.\n",
            "989: But beyond the return to normalcy, Biden will face a critical choice even before he is sworn into office: between Democrats who crave a resumption of the policies of former President Barack Obama and those who want to correct Obama’s missteps — including some glaring failures in Syria or on Russia relations — and to forge a new U.S. foreign policy doctrine for the 21st century.\n",
            "990: Where Biden stands will quickly be evident in how he builds his Cabinet and fills senior posts.\n",
            "991: Biden’s inner circle, led by Blinken, aged 58, is a generation younger than their boss, who will turn 78 next month.\n",
            "992: Blinken and McKeon worked for Biden for many years as top aides on the Senate foreign relations committee; Haines also briefly worked on the committee when Biden was chairman.\n",
            "993: Blinken, Sullivan, Carpenter, McKeon and Smith all worked in Biden’s vice presidential office.\n",
            "994: And Carpenter and McKeon have run the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement at the University of Pennsylvania, an institute created after Biden left office in 2017.\n",
            "995: Then there’s the larger foreign policy establishment, in which Biden has spent most of his career.\n",
            "996: “Biden and his team will have to find some way to reshape U.S. foreign policy and revive the United States’ sense of its purpose in the world,” he wrote.\n",
            "997: A Biden victory in November would offer the temptation of seeking to restore the United States’ post–Cold War image of itself as a virtuous hegemon.\n",
            "998: There is no doubt Biden and his team would mark a return to more traditional foreign policy — renewed support for multilateral organizations and long-held alliances; less tweeting and courting of strongmen like Russian President Vladimir Putin or Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n",
            "999: “There’s a choice that the Biden folks are going to have to make,” said one member of the Blob, who has advised the campaign and spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing chances of a job.\n",
            "1000: “People don’t quite know — what is Biden trying to do?” the campaign adviser said.\n",
            "1001: While much attention has focused on a debate between progressive Democrats like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren and centrists like Biden, Wright focuses on a more nuanced split between the centrists, which Biden will have to referee.\n",
            "1002: Contenders for secretary of state include Senator Chris Coons, who currently holds Biden’s old seat from Delaware; Senator Chris Murphy, a relative young and progressive member of the foreign relations committee from Connecticut; Susan Rice, who served as ambassador to the U.N. and national security adviser for Obama; and Samantha Power, another former U.N. envoy.\n",
            "1003: Compared with Trump, who waged a war against the alleged “deep state” throughout his presidency, Biden will certainly put greater faith in all of his advisers, and especially in the U.S. foreign policy and intelligence communities.\n",
            "1004: Indeed, Obama chose Biden as his running mate largely because of Biden’s foreign policy experience.\n",
            "1005: While the Tonys have Biden’s ear when needed, nearly anyone who is anyone in EU foreign policy knows Joe or, at least, has met him.\n",

            "1918: But Monday, Biden went harder at Netanyahu as he sketched out a reality he said that’s left him feeling that “the path for peace is shrouded.”\n",

            "1926: “We are Israel’s maybe not-only friend,” Biden said, “but only absolutely certain friend.”\n",
            "1927: But Joseph Biden’s firm public commitment that he would select a woman as his running mate in the event he stays atop the Democratic race and is the party’s 2020 nominee is historically unprecedented: No major candidate has ever made such a pledge based on demographic characteristics, nor has one narrowed the field of potential vice presidential nominees this early in the year, several months before the decision is usually made.\n",
            "1928: Bernie Sanders, the only other candidate still competing in an election cycle in which debate stages once had to accommodate as many as 20 candidates over two nights, matched Biden’s hard pledge with a soft one, saying that “in all likelihood” he would also name a women as long as she shares his progressive views and that “my very strong tendency to move in that direction.”\n",
            "1929: The moment showed Biden signaling that his thoughts are already far advanced into the politics of the general election.\n",
            "1930: In giving up a measure of latitude about his choice, Biden also seemed to be suggesting something about how he views himself and how he wants other Democrats to view him: Not necessarily as the most commanding figure or someone clinging to personal prerogatives, but the sturdiest vessel to accommodate the party’s disparate demographic and ideological blocs.\n",
            "1931: Sturdy, in fact, seemed to be the motif for Biden’s two-hour performance, held without an audience at CNN’s Washington studio.\n",
            "1932: The last time Biden was on a debate stage was two weeks ago, in South Carolina.\n",
            "1933: History has pivoted in those two weeks, both for Biden and the country.\n",
            "1934: That pivot imposed some new questions on Biden and Sanders both as they entered the debate.\n",
            "1935: Even so, Biden opened the evening with a sober tone and factual recitation of measures he wants to fight the pandemic, including expanded testing via drive-through locations in every state, enlisting the military to help expand the pool of hospital beds, and quick action on spending to help people who have lost jobs and to offset the deadening effect on the economy.\n",
            "1936: Biden appeared more relaxed in a two-person contest, compared to earlier debates when he often receded in the noise or gave answers that bordered on unintelligible.\n",
            "1937: Biden was plainly eager to propitiate progressives, offering words of praise for departed candidate Elizabeth Warren and noting that he had spoken with her this week in support of her effort to modify a bankruptcy law that Biden helped pass in 2005.\n",
            "1938: Biden’s pledge to pick a woman as running mate, though plainly planned and not spontaneous, came during a rebuttal to Sanders, who said he intended a cabinet that “will look like America,” and boasted of his superior record on abortion rights and affordable childcare for working women.\n",
            "1939: Biden said in reply that he intended to name a black woman to the Supreme Court, as well as a woman to be his vice president: “There are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow.”\n",
            "1940: Biden repeated and at times intensified his frequent criticism of Sanders’ plans for such things as mandatory Medicare for All as too expensive and unworkable.\n",
            "1941: The Vermont senator came eager to debate his ideological arguments—especially on curbing corporate power, expanding health care, and mobilizing to fight climate change—and said he worries that Biden would have problems mobilizing young people in a general election against President Donald Trump.\n",
            "1942: But he did not try to light up Biden in sharply personal ways, in the fashion that Warren did successfully against former candidate Michael Bloomberg in the two previous debates.\n",
            "1943: Instead, Sanders portrayed Biden as well-intentioned but timid.\n",
            "1944: On climate change, for instance, he told Biden: “I know your heart is in the right place, but this requires dramatic, bold action.\n",
            "1945: This is hardly the kind of language that is impossible to walk back, or that gets in the way of an eventual endorsement, which Sanders says he will give to Biden if his own comeback plans don’t materialize.\n",
            "1946: Sanders peevishly needled Biden for a decade ago backing the Bowles-Simpson budget commission, which contemplated curbing the growth in spending for Social Security, Medicare, and veterans benefits.\n",
            "1947: Biden denied backing the commission, or any plans to cut popular entitlements.\n",
            "1948: That may well suit Biden just fine.\n",
            "1949: There was nothing over two hours of debate that seemed to fundamentally change the trajectory of the race, and that trajectory right now is favoring Biden.\n",
            "1950: London hopes to distinguish itself from Brussels, whose new investment deal with Beijing has gone down badly with the Biden team.\n",
            "1951: LONDON — In the race to be Joe Biden’s best friend in Europe, the U.K. has a plan — to be different on China.\n",
            "1952: While Wednesday’s inauguration of the 46th president of the United States will spell the end of Donald Trump’s blame-China-for-everything approach, early signals from Joe Biden’s transition team are that Washington will not be going soft on Beijing — and doesn’t want allies to either.\n",
            "1953: Officials in Boris Johnson’s government hope their mixture of toughness and foreign policy pragmatism will rhyme with Biden's — and set them apart from Brussels, Berlin and Paris.\n",
            "1954: Even so, U.K. officials say their approach stands in contrast to the EU, which, as the U.K.’s former national security adviser Mark Sedwill noted in an article in the Daily Mail on the eve of Biden’s inauguration, \"rushed through\" a new investment deal with China days before the new president takes office.\n",
            "1955: The deal went ahead despite Biden's incoming National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan requesting that the EU take the U.S.'s \"common concerns\" into account — something Biden's team are \"deeply unhappy about,\" according to Sedwill.\n",
            "1956: While Biden’s opposition to Brexit and previous critical comments about Boris Johnson have been much-discussed as reasons why the “special relationship” might suffer, U.K. officials have been at pains to point out how — on many matters of substance — London is much more in tune with Biden than it ever was with Trump.\n",
            "1957: Climate change, the promotion of democratic values and the U.K.’s willingness to back up good diplomatic intentions with defense spending are all areas that U.K. diplomats have highlighted to counterparts in Biden’s team, officials said.\n",
            "1958: U.K. officials are pitching the country as a partner for Biden in helping to build those international alliances.\n",
            "1959: With Biden’s foreign policy agenda emphasizing the strengthening of democratic alliances after an era of Trumpist unilateralism, the U.K. also has two major international events in 2021 to ram home its usefulness as a convenor of like-minded nations, hosting both the G7 summit in June and COP26 U.N. climate change meeting in November.\n",
            "1960: The U.K.'s stated priorities for the meeting had Biden’s foreign policy goals plainly in sight, said Sophia Gaston, director of the London-based British Foreign Policy Group think tank.\n",
            "1961: Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is not expected to visit Washington until the coronavirus situation allows, with expectations that Biden’s team will make a point of permitting only absolutely essential diplomatic exchanges while virus cases remain high.\n",
            "1962: For the EU, Joe Biden’s first overseas trip as U.S. president was like having big brother come home from university — just in time to confront the neighborhood bully.\n",
            "1963: After four days at busy leaders’ summits of the G7 and NATO, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel finally got a chance to sit down with Biden on Tuesday for their own quiet conversation about EU-U.S. relations, before sending him off to Geneva where he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n",
            "1964: The meeting on Tuesday was nothing short of a lovefest, with perhaps the only disagreement being who was happiest, Biden or the Europeans, that Donald Trump is no longer president of the United States.\n",
            "1965: “Well, Mr. President, dear Joe, we are so pleased to welcome you in Brussels,” von der Leyen said, as she joined Michel to greet Biden on the red carpet of the Council’s Europa building.\n",
            "1966: Biden quickly picked up the theme.\n",
            "1967: As a down payment on rejuvenated relations, Biden agreed to a truce in the nastiest, longest-running cross-Atlantic trade feud — the battle over state subsidies to the airplane manufacturers Airbus and Boeing.\n",
            "1968: The EU side did acknowledge that it was time for Biden and the U.S. to get more serious about carbon pricing, as part of the global response to climate change.\n",
            "1969: That Biden did not even bother to stick around for the closing news conference was also quickly forgiven.\n",
            "1970: On trade, she said it was good Biden had dropped Trump’s pretense for tariffs.\n",
            "1971: But she was even happier about Biden’s views on the transatlantic relationship.\n",
            "1972: “It was impressive to see and to listen to President Biden how clearly he, first of all, was acknowledging that yes, we know that the last four years were difficult and the world has changed, but Europe has also changed,” von der Leyen said.\n",
            "1973: A first test of how well they will do on the stability and security front will be Biden’s high-stakes meeting in Geneva, where the Europeans are counting on him to try to at least set the stage for a breakthrough with Putin.\n",
            "1974: But the Europeans must also consider how dismal ties are between Moscow and Washington and how big a hole Biden and Putin need to climb out of after years of ill-will.\n",
            "1975: Samuel Charap, senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, said that the Biden-Putin confrontation might be regarded as successful if they could agree on such minor steps as restoring normal diplomatic relations, with ambassadors back in each other’s capitals.\n",
            "1976: Von der Leyen said Europe hoped to join forces with Biden so there is “clear pushback on breaches of international law; clear pushback on breaches of human rights” and “secondly, to constrain Russia’s attempts to undermine us.”\n",
            "1977: “But,” she said, “the EU-Russia relationship is on a negative spiral and this is what we conveyed clearly to President Biden.”\n",
            "1978: LONDON — Joe Biden’s arrival in the White House will push the U.K. to work more closely with the EU — but won’t be the thing that clinches a Brexit deal.\n",
            "1979: Biden becomes U.S. president-elect at a critical moment in Brexit talks, as negotiators enter the final weeks where agreement is possible if the U.K. is going to leave the transition period at the end of the year with a trade deal in place.\n",

            "1982: \"Now that Joe Biden is going to be the next president of the United States, that will be a cause for, certainly, a pause for thought in No. 10, to ensure that Irish issues are prioritized as we try to close out this phase of the Brexit negotiation,\" Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told RTÉ radio Monday.\n",
            "1983: \"The statements that have come — not only from Joe Biden but from many on Capitol Hill — that if the Good Friday Agreement and peace on the island of Ireland isn’t protected through Brexit, that securing a trade deal between the U.S. and U.K. would be very, very problematic.\"\n",

            "1985: Even if there is a no-deal Brexit and the British government takes steps that breach the Good Friday Agreement, Ruparel argues, its breaching would be such a massive issue for British politics that what Biden does in retaliation or whether he holds a U.K.-U.S. trade deal to ransom “would be entirely irrelevant.”\n",

            "2001: By failing to consult EU nations about the new Indo-Pacific strategy, under which Australia canceled a blockbuster contract to buy French submarines, Michel said Biden had discarded an agreement reached by leaders after many hours of talks at the G7 summit in Britain in June to remain united in confronting authoritarian regimes, particularly China.\n",
            "2002: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen voiced her own dismay during an interview with CNN, in which she called the treatment of France  “unacceptable” and demanded Biden provide an explanation.\n",
            "2003: Biden, on the other hand, talked a big game about renewing transatlantic ties, according to Michel, but then railroaded European allies with his decision about following through on Trump’s plan to withdraw from Afghanistan, “and,” he added, “a few days ago with this strange announcement.”\n",
            "2004: Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden agreed Tuesday to extend the New START nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which is due to expire next month, according to Kremlin and White House summaries of a phone call between the leaders.\n",

            "2012: Biden’s already been deployed to mitigate that damage by Obama.\n",
            "2013: Just on Monday, on a stop at a Clinton campaign office in Toledo, Biden said that he’d spoken to the Latvian president, who’d urged him to come to Europe and reassure people that if Russia invades, NATO will defend them.\n",
            "2014: At that same stop, Biden said he’d hoped to continue some level of involvement in domestic and foreign policy, but added, “I may write a book.\n",
            "2015: Clinton and Biden have a long history together, going back to her days as first lady.\n",
            "2016: Biden bristled at being portrayed as a holdout in greenlighting the raid that killed Osama bin Laden while Clinton was a seen as a strong advocate, and the day before he pulled the plug on running, publicly corrected the record to say he’d privately advised Obama to go ahead with it.\n",
            "2017: In Biden, Clinton would be tapping a seasoned hand on foreign policy, a glad-handing pol with a long memory and a well of deep relationships around the globe.\n",
            "2018: During the Obama administration’s lengthy review of Afghanistan policy early in his tenure, for instance, a skeptical Biden urged the president not to escalate the war, while Clinton backed Gen.\n",
            "2019: Clinton’s campaign was anxious about Biden running — and was watching carefully enough to be gaming out whether he’d announce in an appearance on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert last September, as shown in emails revealed by the WikiLeaks hack.\n",
            "2020: But none of those picks would come with the star power that’s been a feature for all recent picks for the job, and which Biden would bring in buckets.\n",

            "2023: Sunak attended one of England’s most expensive public schools and is married to a billionaire heiress; Biden plays up his blue collar credentials — not to mention his Irish heritage — whenever he gets the chance.\n",
            "2024: But across gaping divides of age, class and political tradition, Sunak has worked hard to maximize his relationship with Biden in the seven short months he’s been in office.\n",
            "2025: Those efforts appeared to pay off at the culmination of this week’s trip to Washington — Sunak’s first as U.K. prime minister — when Biden spoke in glowing terms about his counterpart’s ability to lead.\n",
            "2026: Sunak was pleased, too, with Biden’s playful nod toward the prospect of a British NATO secretary-general, talking up Ben Wallace’s long-shot candidacy when incumbent Jens Stoltenberg finally retires.\n",

            "2032: Biden’s press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, has noted the frequency with which he and Sunak have met — Thursday’s meeting being their fifth since Sunak came to power last October, and their fourth in the past four months.\n",
            "2033: Privately, Biden’s aides say he has appreciated Sunak’s eagerness to lean into the relationship, and his desire to restrict engagements to solely the two leaders where possible, in an effort to get to know the president better.\n",
            "2034: That’s gone down well with Biden, aides say, noting the president prefers to keep meetings informal and allow for personal conversation to flow.\n",
            "2035: If anything, Sunak’s deference to Biden’s experience on the international stage has endeared him to the octogenarian president, multiple U.S. officials say.\n",
            "2036: With Sunak, as with other international counterparts in their mid-40s such as Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen — both of whom also met with Biden in recent weeks — the president sees an opportunity to impart the perspective of a leader who has lived through decades of geopolitical convulsions.\n",
            "2037: “Biden wants someone to carry on the mantle defending their shared values, and Rishi of course respects Biden’s foreign policy experience.” Sunak has told colleagues he is particularly impressed by Biden’s extensive track record of dealing with China.\n",
            "2038: It helps that Sunak is on a stronger footing domestically than his ill-fated predecessor, Liz Truss, meaning Biden feels time invested in the relationship is not going to waste.\n",
            "2039: Biden did not appreciate Johnson’s wisecracks about G7 leaders taking off their shirts at the summit in Germany last year, according to two people close to the president.\n",
            "2040: Biden, too, loves sugary snacks, with chocolate chip ice cream a personal favorite.\n",
            "2041: But while Harris is more attuned to her party’s progressive wing than Biden and keen to placate it, her position is, if anything, more reflective of a changing America— especially in terms of demographics.\n",
            "2042: For all the tensions and disagreements between Netanyahu and Washington over Israel’s Gaza campaign — including its civilian death toll and the risk of sparking a full-blown regional war — Biden has lived up to his claim of being a self-described Zionist president, once again emphasizing his lifelong bond with Israel as recently as July.\n",
            "2043: Of course, Biden did threaten to withhold some arms supplies from Israel in a failed attempt to cajole Netanyahu to agree to a cease-fire or ratchet down the campaign in Gaza.\n",
            "2044: But others aren’t quite so upbeat, and they worry that Biden may well be among the last U.S. presidents who self-identify as Zionist.\n",
            "2045: But Mark Gitenstein, Joe Biden’s choice to be U.S. envoy to the EU, is a beneficiary of the president’s “personal privilege.”\n",
            "2046: Gitenstein, 74, is a close friend of the president and longtime aide, who was literally at Biden’s shoulder for much of 1987 — arguably the most pivotal year in Biden’s lifelong career in public service.\n",
            "2047: At the time, Gitenstein was chief counsel to the Judiciary Committee, and he can be seen in a video of Bork’s high-drama confirmation hearings, perched behind Biden’s right shoulder, as strategically placed — and nearly as close-at-hand — as the senator’s gold-plated wooden gavel propped on the table in front of him.\n",
            "2048: Gitenstein was succeeded in the chief counsel job in 1989 by Ron Klain, now the White House chief of staff, and the ranks of future Biden Senate staffers would eventually include the likes of Antony Blinken, now secretary of state.\n",
            "2049: But it was 1987 and the defeat of the Bork nomination that defined Biden’s future and, as a result, means the EU will soon get an ambassador who has not only the president’s ear but also a piece of his heart.\n",
            "2050: Biden described their friendship during a visit to Bucharest, as Barack Obama’s vice president, in 2009 when Gitenstein was U.S. ambassador to Romania.\n",
            "2051: “There’s an expression when you stand up on the floor of the Senate, if you are going to talk about something personally, Mr. President, we say please excuse the point of personal privilege,” Biden said.\n",
            "2052: At a time when Biden has put a huge premium on restoring transatlantic relations, it's fitting that he would send Brussels an ambassador he considers a relation of his own.\n",
            "2053: Having helped to lead Biden’s vice presidential transition team, Gitenstein was in line for a senior Justice Department position, as head of the Office of Legal Policy, only to be thwarted by criticism from some advocacy groups about his decades as a private lawyer and lobbyist representing big corporate interests.\n",
            "2054: Eisen, who worked on Obama’s presidential campaign and as a special counsel in the White House before being nominated as an ambassador, said that Gitenstein would benefit in the Brussels post both from his prior experience as a diplomat and his long relationship with Biden.\n",
            "2055: His long tenure with President Biden and his closeness to the president matters to how he is perceived by the Europeans, but they also matter to getting the job done.”\n",
            "2056: He was replaced as acting ambassador by Ronald Gidwitz, who was Trump’s ambassador to Belgium and resigned upon Biden’s inauguration in January.\n",
            "2057: Gitenstein is still awaiting Senate confirmation and while his history as a staffer on Capitol Hill will no doubt accrue to his benefit, he also risks getting ensnared in some broader complaints or criticisms that Republican lawmakers have with Biden’s policies toward Europe, especially the president’s decision not to levy sanctions on German firms over Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and instead reach an accommodation with Germany.\n",
            "2058: Bush, said Gitenstein would likely face some scrutiny by Republicans as a result of Biden’s relatively slow approach to dealing with some issues, like trade, on which the U.S. and the EU have substantive disagreements.\n",
            "2059: “I think the Europeans have been a little surprised at the Biden administration's lack of trade policy,” said Conley who is now senior vice president for Europe, Eurasia and the Arctic, as well as director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n",
            "2060: While there is a marked difference in tone compared to Trump’s belligerence, Conley noted that on substance so far, the Biden team had changed little.\n",
            "2061: For Gitenstein, the EU ambassador post is a belated benefit from the fight that defined his career and Biden’s in 1987.\n",
            "2062: And it would take Biden another 33 years to realize his dream of being elected president.\n",
            "2063: After last year's election victory, Gitenstein once again jumped into action, joining Biden’s closest confidante Ted Kaufman in leading the presidential transition.\n",
            "2064: Gitenstein’s own 1992 book about the Bork nomination describes how Biden as a senator felt he was fighting for a way of interpreting the U.S. Constitution that would serve all U.S. citizens in the modern era, rather than the strict narrow approach favored by Reagan’s arch-conservative nominee.\n",
            "2065: “I would like to thank my friend Senator Joseph Biden,” he wrote, “who had the confidence in me to make me Chief Counsel of the Senate Judiciary Committee so that I could participate in the events described in this book.”\n",

            "2068: Joe Biden officially announced his bid for president Thursday, marking the third White House campaign of his lengthy political career but the first in which he enters as a front-runner.\n",
            "2069: For months, Biden anguished about whether to mount another White House run.\n",
            "2070: Biden ran headlong into the dynamic before he even announced when a former Nevada Democratic assemblywoman, Lucy Flores, accused him of inappropriately touching her in an overly friendly manner.\n",
            "2071: Three other Democratic women also came forward, plunging Biden’s not-yet-a-campaign into crisis mode and highlighting a generational divide in which Biden was criticized as being out of touch with the changing times.\n",
            "2072: But Biden’s belief that he’s uniquely situated to defeat President Donald Trump, as well as the encouragement from party elders and rank-and-file voters, made it impossible for him to sit out the election, even after more than 20 candidates jumped in and new progressive groups vowed to launch a Never Biden campaign.\n",
            "2073: “The primary isn’t anchored but now it becomes more centered around Biden,” said Joe Trippi, a veteran adviser of Democratic presidential campaigns.\n",

            "2075: Beto O’Rourke could position himself against Biden as old vs.\n",
            "2076: The race, however, won’t be a clear referendum on Biden because the unstable politics of the times and the growing number — and dynamic quality — of other candidates makes it difficult to get a clear picture of the field, Trippi and others say.\n",
            "2077: One of Biden’s paths to defending his lead is to make the case that his age — he’ll be 78 in 2020 — is not a liability, but an asset that brings deep experience on the national and world stage at a time when Democrats are hungry for a win.\n",
            "2078: And as top Democratic contenders drift leftward, Biden’s team hopes his record it will give him an advantage with moderate voters, who might be more of a silent plurality than social media — fueled by the loud voices progressive activists — suggests.\n",

            "2081: But Lake says while the media might comb through Biden’s record, fellow Democratic contenders are unlikely to aim their fire at him, instead focusing resources on their own name ID and searching for a breakout moment.\n",
            "2082: Biden’s entry into the race caps months of private deliberation over whether to run, shifting announcement dates that kept getting pushed off as his future opponents hired staff and leaks that claimed he was planning to pick an early running mate — Stacey Abrams, the failed Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia — to help him win.\n",
            "2083: But the accounts only fed speculation that Biden felt a desperate need to shore up support in the changing party.\n",
            "2084: Biden has a slight lead or is neck-and-neck with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in most national and early state polls.\n",
            "2085: However, Biden’s support is strong among older, white voters who typically make up more than half of the electorate that most often votes in Democratic primaries.\n",
            "2086: And while Sanders was within just 2 percentage points of Biden in a recent Iowa poll, 70 percent of those queried said they see Biden’s views on the issues “about right” while 48 percent said Sanders’ views are “too liberal.”\n",
            "2087: Biden lost his two prior races for president in 1988, after a plagiarism scandal, and in 2008 when Barack Obama captured the Democratic Party’s heart and pulled an upset win in early state Iowa, putting to rest any doubts that he was electable.\n",
            "2088: The theory of Biden’s case this time: He connects with middle-class voters, is respected worldwide by foreign leaders, has deep government experience and would bring a sense of normalcy and stability that voters crave in the Trump era.\n",

            "2092: Biden’s Rust Belt appeal was part of the reason that Obama chose him as his running mate in 2008.\n",
            "2093: Back then, Biden served as an ambassador to white swing and working-class voters, and the veteran senator added a touch of gravitas to the ticket for the exciting but relatively inexperienced hope-and-change candidate.\n",
            "2094: However, as the former right-hand man and running mate of the popular former president, Biden has a natural constituency of supporters in the party, including African-Americans for whom the first black president is history made flesh.\n",
            "2095: Biden trounced the field in a recent poll, with 43 percent of African-Americans polled saying they supported the former vice president.\n",
            "2096: Biden’s support among black voters, however, is likely to be tested in the new progressive era as his past opposition to forced busing in 1972 and his authorship of the 1994 crime bill that helped lead to a wave of mass incarceration of African-Americans are revisited.\n",

            "2102: “It was a big mistake when it was made,” Biden said, using the passive voice and blaming unnamed “experts” who told politicians like him that crack was worse and somehow fundamentally different.\n",
