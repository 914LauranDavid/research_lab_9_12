"“By strategic design or dumb luck,” the political scientists noted, “the Trump candidacy was able to activate a segment of the electorate that has historically not been part of the GOP electoral coalition.”Earlier this year, the results of a Roosevelt Institute/ Democracy Corpsfocus groupconfirmed both the belief that racism has put some of these voters out of reach and the argument that others can be won back with better economic appeals.Many saw Clinton as a wealthy ally of Wall Street and genuinely believed Trump’s claims that his wealth meant he wouldn’t be beholden to deep-pocketed donors. But they expect him to deliver the jobs and good, cheap health care he promised — promises he’s of course failed to keep.Two-thirds of the focus group liked Democrats like Sanders, Sherrod Brown, and Elizabeth Warren, “who support American jobs and strongly opposed NAFTA and Obama’s trade deal, support policies to protect consumers from Wall Street and reckless banks, want to get corporations to invest in their own workers and this country, want to end tax breaks for companies sending jobs overseas, and want to bar secret corporate campaign money so our government works for the middle class again.”The sobering reality for Democrats is that Clinton lost much of this group on economic issues, not “cultural” ones. While college-less white moderates enthusiastically support increased taxation of the rich and a variety of social programs, they’re convinced that most politicians only care about the wealthy and have no real interest in pursuing policies that benefit non-elites.The result is a kind of desultory fiscal conservatism, born not out of ideology, but cynicism.",left,2012

But a progressive vision that fails to see all forms of inequality as injustices in and of themselves is no progressive vision at all.While the Obama administration made some gains in reducing inequality — particularly compared to other post-1960s presidents — most of the redistribution occurred as a result of the ACA’s shifting of income from the top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans to the bottom 20 percent of Americans. Little of the redistribution reached Americans above the fortieth percentile — meaning that the main policy changes undertaken during Obama’s presidency failed to unite the poor with the working and middle classes.As the administrationitself admitted, Obama’s policies countered only “roughly one-tenth of the increase in the share of after-tax income accruing to the top 1 percent over the last three decades.” The bottom 95 percent of Americans still have a smaller share of after-tax income than they did in 1979.For decades, Democrats have crafted policies that favor complex “nudges,” “kludges,” and “market-based solutions.” They’ve hoped that funneling progressive programs through the tax code instead of setting up new programs would curb conservative opposition.Yet not only have such strategies failed to blunt the GOP’s attacks on the welfare state, they’ve also created what political scientist Suzanne Mettler has dubbed the “submerged state.” By shrouding government largesse in layers of complexity, Democratshave made it seemthat such benefits are natural, rather than the product of state intervention.",left,2012

"WASHINGTON (AP) — A year from Election Day, Democrats are crafting a campaign strategy for Vice President Joe Biden that targets the big three political battlegrounds: Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida, states where Biden might be more of an asset to President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign than the president himself. The Biden plan underscores an uncomfortable reality for the Obama team. A shaky economy and sagging enthusiasm among Democrats could shrink the electoral map for Obama in 2012, forcing his campaign to depend on carrying the 67 electoral votes up for grabs in the three swing states. Obama won all three states in 2008.",center,2012

"Obama won all three states in 2008. But this time he faces challenges in each, particularly in Ohio and Florida, where voters elected Republican governors in the 2010 midterm elections.",center,2012
"“Talking to blue-collar voters is perhaps his greatest attribute,” said Dan Schnur, a Republican political analyst. “Obama provides the speeches, and Biden provides the blue-collar subtitles.” While Biden’s campaign travel won’t kick into high gear until next year, he’s already been making stops in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida this fall, speaking at events focused on education, public safety and small businesses and raising campaign cash. Behind the scenes, he’s working the phones with prominent Jewish groups and Catholic organizations in those states, a Democratic official said. Biden is also targeting organized labor, speaking frequently with union leaders in Ohio ahead of a vote earlier this month on a state law that would have curbed collective bargaining rights for public workers.",center,2012
"The Democratic official said the vice president will also be a frequent visitor to Iowa and New Hampshire in the coming weeks, seeking to steal some of the spotlight from the Republican presidential candidates blanketing those states ahead of the January caucus and primary. And while Obama may have declared that he won’t be commenting on the Republican presidential field until there’s a nominee, Biden is following no such rules. He’s calling out GOP candidates by name, and in true Biden style, he appears to be relishing in doing so. During a speech last month to the Florida Democratic Convention, Biden singled out “Romney and Rick”, criticizing former Massachusetts Gov.",center,2012

"And he took on the full GOP field during an October fundraiser in New Hampshire, saying “There is no fundamental difference among all the Republican candidates.” Democratic officials said Biden will follow in the long-standing tradition of vice presidents playing the role of attack dog, allowing Obama to stay out of the fray and appear more focused on governing than campaigning. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal strategy.",center,2012
"The Obama campaign has been reluctant to publically define Biden’s role in the re-election bid this early in the run, though campaign manager Jim Messina did say the vice president would deliver an economic message to appeal for support. “You’ll see him in communities across the country next year laying out the choice we face: restoring economic security for the middle class or returning to the same policies that led to our economic challenges,” Messina said.",center,2012
"And here again, the vice president’s efforts in politically crucial Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida could be most important. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is targeting 12 districts in those states that Obama and Biden carried in the 2008 presidential race but are represented by Republican representatives. New York Rep. Steve Israel, who chairs the committee, said he believes Biden could be a “game-changer” in those districts.",center,2012
