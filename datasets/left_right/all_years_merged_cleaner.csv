These were the kinds of attacks that DLC types had feared most, but Obama couldn't escape them.As a result, the Obama campaign put its efforts less into winning over the mythical ""soccer moms"" or other moderate suburban whites and more into turning out former nonvoters andfirst-timevoters, many of whom were people of color or Millennials.Two strategy stories emerged from Obama's campaign, and, in time, the perceived importance of each would shape future Democratic campaigns - including Clinton's ill-fated 2016 run. One gave priority to the door-to-door people power of Obama'sground game.

Even President Obama, who focused on inequality more than any post-LBJ Democrat, refused to break free from the ""opportunity"" framework.

Hillary Clinton's new book blasts Bernie Sanders for offering ""free ponies"" instead of hardheaded policy.And last month, Will Marshall, one of the cofounders of the Democratic Leadership Council - the preeminent group of neoliberal Democrats in the 1980s and '90s -joinedwith other centrist Democrats to form New Democracy, a group that once again aims to stanch the electoral bleeding among working-class whites and further court well-off whites by steering the party right -away from the ""distraction,"" as Marshallput it, of progressive policies like single-payer health care.By focusing on the role of white voters in Clinton's defeat, rather than the failure of the Democrats' neoliberal strategy, liberal pundits and party leaders are drawing the wrong conclusions from Trump's victory. Instead of debating how to win white workers or doubling down on the misguided strategy of courting upscale whites, Democrats must train their attention on the needs of the working class as a whole.This doesn't just mean that the party must retain its concern with racial, gender, and sexual inequalities.",left,2020

Ordinary Americans are experiencing increased political alienation, causing them to lose confidence in government institutions and turn to antidemocratic alternatives.

What had passed for straight-shooting and candor in an America and a Democratic Party twenty years younger and far less diverse now came off as offensive, out of touch, and old-fashioned.With his number-one selling point neutralized, a lack of ambitious proposals dealing with Americans' pressing material concerns, and no 1987-style youth appeal to paper over his deficiencies, Biden fell far behind Obama, Clinton, and several others in both fundraising and polling, even running second in his own state.",left,2020

The stimulus had come in for a lot of criticism already in part because Biden needlessly assured the press that ""some of this money is going to be wasted"" and ""some people are being scammed already."" To show what would happen to recipients of stimulus funds who failed to file the necessary reports, Biden's team chose to make an example of a nonprofit that provided food to hungry children, denying it any further funds as punishment.Biden's work was such a success that it earned him the nickname ""Sheriff"" from Obama - and his appointment to its sequel: the Campaign to Cut Waste, launched two years later to ""hunt down misspent tax dollars in every agency and department of this government,"" in Obama's words.",left,2020

But few knew Biden's history, and what little they did know - his tough-on-crime history, his foreign policy record - the press viewed as strengths, floating only his ""gaffes"" and campaign-era criticism of Obama as potential problems.Obama's charisma, apparent progressivism, inspiring calls for ""change,"" and the historic nature of his candidacy brought the long-dormant Democratic base to the polls, facing down one of the more racist Republican campaigns in modern memory, with its insinuations that Obama was a terrorist.",left,2020

Though Biden too had become more liberal on the issue, whatever political benefit he might have gained from this was undone in 2003, when, after voting repeatedly over the preceding eight years for a ban on so-called ""partial-birth"" abortions, he cast a vote that helped make the measure law under Bush Jr. When the Supreme Court controversially upheld the law in 2007 - a ruling celebrated by abortion foes as the ""crack in the dike"" that would eventually overturnRoe- Biden was not only the very last Democratic presidential candidate to issue a statement condemning it, doing so only at the prodding of his hometown paper, but he then told Democratic voters he made ""no apologies"" for his 2003 vote.As in 1987, bold, ambitious proposals would not be Biden's selling point for his latest White House run.",left,2020
"The Democrats' reward for kowtowing to finance has been to watch Wall Street return to the GOP fold whenever convenient -includingfollowing Trump's victory.Instead of keeping taxes on the rich low and regulation on business light in a futile attempt to out-GOP the GOP, Democrats should work to curb the economic and political power of corporations and the well-off at every turn. Rather than stoking economic growth and elevating wages, low taxes on upper incomes have onlyboostedinequality andhandedmoney to the rich that they've turned around and used tolobbyfor even more regressive, capital-friendly policies.Ultimately, Hillary Clinton's defeat can't be attributed to the moral failings of the white working class or the political savvy of Donald Trump, but to the utter failure of neoliberals' strategy.

The complication, which goes unacknowledged in the resulting argument, is that Biden has openly courted many of these same interests over the course of his campaign: hislist of fundraisers, advisors, and donorsbeing a veritable who's who of bagmen from the illustrious realms of Big Pharma, banking, real estate, and private equity.",left,2020

"Following Democrat Joe Biden's victory, Trump has sought to discredit the integrity of the election and argued without evidence that the results will be overturned. Republican lawmakers have said the president should be allowed to launch legal challenges, though many of those lawsuits have already been turned away by judges and those that remain do not include evidence of problems that would change the outcome of the race.",center,2020
"Trump's endorsement two years ago helped Kemp win a heated Republican primary and eke out a narrow general election victory over Democrat Stacey Abrams. Even after losing the White House, Trump is expected to remain a powerful influence with GOP voters in the upcoming Senate runoffs in Georgia as well as in 2022, when Kemp will have to seek reelection.",center,2020
"Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, perhaps Biden's biggest cheerleader in Pennsylvania. In neighboring Luzerne County, where Democrats have steadily lost ground to Republicans, Biden was beaten soundly but still managed to whittle down Trump's 2016 margin of victory. Meanwhile, Biden rolled up decisive margins in Philadelphia's populous suburbs, doing better against Trump than even Clinton, who had racked up historic vote totals there four years ago.",center,2020
"In fact, argued Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who tracks vote counts for the U.S. Elections Project, the relatively narrow Biden wins in battleground states tell a different story than the one the president is pushing. Democrats have worried thatthe gap between the popular vote and the Electoral College talliesis growing as Democratic voters cluster on the coasts and outside of battleground states. That dynamic could make it difficult for Democrats to win congressional races, creating a lasting disadvantage when it comes to advancing policies.",center,2020
"Trump won much of the South, Texas and rural, sparsely populated states in the Mountain West and Midwest. Biden's win in Pennsylvania was a dramatic, though not unexpected, turn after Trump jumped out to an early Election Day lead of 675,000 votes and prematurely declared he had won the state. Over coming days, as local elections officials tabulated more ballots, Trump's lead dropped sharply, with Biden winning roughly 75 percent of the mail-in vote between Wednesday and Friday, according to an analysis by the AP. Another reason the late-breaking mail vote broke Biden's way: Under state law, elections officials are not allowed to process mail-in ballots until Election Day.",center,2020
"Dozens of Trump supporters chanting ""Stop the count!"" descended on a ballot-tallying center in Detroit, while thousands of anti-Trump protesters demanding a complete vote count took to the streets in cities across the U.S. Protests - sometimes about the election, sometimes about racial inequality - took place Wednesday in at least a half-dozen cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis and San Diego.",center,2020
"WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump on Sunday appeared to acknowledge for the first time that Joe Biden won the White House, but made clear he would not concede and would keep trying to overturn the election result. Trump's statements came in tweets that included several baseless claims about the Nov.",center,2020
"But legal experts were dubious of Trump's declaration. Trump has appointed three of the high court's nine justices - including, most recently, Amy Coney Barrett. The Trump campaign on Wednesday pushed Republican donors to dig deeper into their pockets to help finance legal challenges. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, during a donor call, spoke plainly: ""The fight's not over.",center,2020
"Georgia's embrace of Biden marked a stark political reversal from 2016, when Trump carried the state by 5 percentage points. Four years ago, Trump was able to coast to victory in Georgia over Democrat Hillary Clinton without having to campaign in the state. Not so in 2020, when the potential for a Democratic upset forced Trump to play defense in Georgia heading into the campaign's final leg. Trump held a large rally in Rome, Georgia, the weekend before Election Day, making a return trip to the state not even three weeks after he campaigned in Macon.",center,2020
"This is the apocalyptic version of American life that President Donald Trump argues would be the dire consequence of turning over the White House to Democrat Joe Biden. ""He'll bury you in regulations, dismantle your police departments, dissolve our borders, confiscate your guns, terminate religious liberty, destroy your suburbs,"" Trump said in one of many over-the-top pronouncements about Biden inthe campaign's final weeks.",center,2020
"Some aspects of his record drew critical scrutiny from fellow Democrats, including his support for the 1994 crime bill, his vote for the 2003 Iraq War and his management of the Clarence Thomas' Supreme Court hearings. Biden's 1988 presidential campaign was done in by plagiarism allegations, and his next bid in 2008 ended quietly. But later that year, he was tapped to be Barack Obama's running mate and he became an influential vice president, steering the administration's outreach to both Capitol Hill and Iraq. While his reputation was burnished by his time in office and his deep friendship with Obama, Biden stood aside for Clinton and opted not to run in 2016 after his adult son Beau died of brain cancer the year before.",center,2020
"ATLANTA (AP) - As Democrat Joe Biden is sworn in Wednesday as the nation's 46th president, Donald Trump's most ardent supporters still believe Biden was not legitimately elected after Trump continues to argue the election was stolen. There is no evidence of the widespread fraud that Trump and his allies have claimed. Republican and Democratic election officials have certified the election as valid.",center,2020
"There was another COVID-19 outbreak in the White House this week, which sickened his chief of staff Mark Meadows. Biden also drew a sharp contrast to Trump through a summer of unrest over the police killings of Black Americans including Breonna Taylor in Kentucky and George Floyd in Minneapolis. Their deaths sparked the largest racial protest movement since the civil rights era.",center,2020
"Electors in North Carolina had their temperatures checked before being allowed to enter the Capitol to vote. Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes withdrew as a Trump elector and was in quarantine because he was exposed to someone with COVID-19. Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whom Trump defeated four years ago, were among New York's 29 electors for Biden and Harris. In New Hampshire, before the state's four electors voted for Biden at the State House in Concord, 13-year-old Brayden Harrington led the group in the Pledge of Allegiance.",center,2020
"And mail-in ballots, which take longer to count since they must be removed from envelopes and verified before they are counted, would favor Biden. That pattern was exacerbated by the fact that many states prohibited early counting of mail-in votes that arrived before Election Day.",center,2020

"Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., who previously served as chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he had urged the former vice president to run and highlighted Biden's potential electability when asked to assess African Americans' feelings.

"Eight months into a pandemic that has disproportionately hit Black and Latino Americans, Biden voters were more likely than Trump voters to say they'd been affected personally by the coronavirus pandemic. And Biden's campaign succeeded in making the election about the controversial president, as well as his leadership on the virus. For Brittany Walker, a 29-year-old nurse in Virginia Beach, Virginia, the tipping point was when Trump himself contracted the virus. She cast her ballot for Biden.",center,2020
"He also argued that Biden wouldn't be able to keep such unrest from spreading to the suburbs. David Zarefsky, who teaches courses about presidential rhetoric at Northwestern, said close examination shows the weakness in Trump's argument about Biden and the suburbs.

"He did not directly address Trump's claims of irregularities but said the state pulled off a successful election with a mix of in-person and mail voting despite the pandemic.

Biden is only the second Democrat in 70 years to win Arizona.",center,2020

"The third president to be impeached, though acquitted in the Senate, Trump will leave office having left an indelible imprint in a tenure defined by the shattering of White House norms and a day-to-day whirlwind of turnover, partisan divide and Twitter blasts. Trump's team has filed a smattering of lawsuits in battleground states, some of which were immediately rebuffed by judges. His personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was holding a news conference in Philadelphia threatening more legal action when the race was called. Biden, born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and raised in Delaware, was one of the youngest candidates ever elected to the Senate.",center,2020
"One big reason for that? For months, Trump has discouraged his supporters from voting that way, falsely claiming that voting by mail would lead to widespread voter fraud. It was a message he kept amplifying Saturday.",center,2020
"Trump falsely said Biden's energy plan ""would mean that America's seniors have no air conditioning during the summer, no heat during the winter and no electricity during peak hours."" During a summer of unrest that followed the police killings of Black men, Trump sought to portray Biden as beholden to the ""radical-left"" forces Trump claimed were behind the protests.

In comments Friday in the Rose Garden about a coronavirus vaccine, Trump said his administration would ""not be going to a lockdown"" to slow the spread of COVID-19, and added that ""whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be? I guess time will tell."" Trump on Sunday renewed his groundless attacks on an election technology firm, Dominion Voting Systems, without evidence of any serious irregularities.
